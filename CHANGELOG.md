# Changelog

## 2026-07-26 (dual-provider intelligence batch)

### `[Release]` v1.18.13

The final v13 batch: turns the dual-provider engine from "evaluate + switch" into a system that supplements, prices honestly, accounts across both venues, and shows what it's doing. Folds tasks #48, #49, #51, #52, #55, #56, #58, #60, #62.

### `[Feature]` Braiins supplement when NiceHash is rationed (#55/#56)

Added a rationing detector: when the NiceHash book has no deep-liquidity block (cumulative delivered supply below `nicehash_deep_liquidity_eh`, default 1 EH/s), the market is treated as rationed. In that state the daemon (a) holds the NiceHash price instead of chasing it up into thin scraps, and (b) runs a supplement - throttles the NiceHash order to 1 PH and un-parks the Braiins bid at its target, so the two deliver ~2 PH in parallel. A small state machine unwinds cleanly on normalisation: Braiins is parked first, then the NiceHash limit is restored to its full target, so NiceHash is never left stuck at 1 PH.

### `[Feature]` Timeline reflects NiceHash events (#52)

NiceHash order/price events (create / edit / park / cancel) are now recorded to `bid_events` with a `provider` column (migration 0125) and shown in the History Timeline, each tagged with a "NiceHash" badge. The Braiins price-chart marker overlay stays Braiins-only so NiceHash markers don't clutter the Braiins market series.

### `[Improvement]` Switch on NiceHash's ACTUAL deliverable price (#60)

The switch decision now compares on `max(current NiceHash order price, desired)`. On the way down, NiceHash's capped + cooled-down decreases lag the target, so this keeps its cost at the real live price until it genuinely converges - Braiins isn't parked on a price the order hasn't reached. A parked order's live price sits far below the fill line, so `max()` falls back to the effective reactivation price and can't cause a flap.

### `[Improvement]` UPTIME / AVG COST DELIVERED / VS HASHPRICE count both providers (#48/#49)

Per-tick NiceHash delivery + spend + active provider are now captured (migration 0126). Uptime credits whichever venue delivered above the noise floor (Braiins counter or NiceHash accepted speed). Avg cost delivered and vs-hashprice blend the real settlement counters from both venues (fee-inclusive - `primary_bid_consumed_sat` is what Braiins charged, NiceHash `payedAmount` is what NiceHash charged incl. margin), weighted by each venue's delivered EH-days. With NiceHash idle the figures reduce exactly to the previous Braiins-only values.

### `[Improvement]` Dashboard reflects parked state (#58)

The hero PRICE follows the active provider - when NiceHash is active it shows the live NiceHash order price (labelled "NiceHash order · active") instead of the parked Braiins bid. Parked Braiins bids (price below the current fill line) are labelled "parked" in the BIDS panel.

### `[Improvement]` NiceHash target + deep-liquidity on the Strategy page (#62)

The NiceHash target hashrate now sits next to the Braiins target under Hashrate targets, and the deep-liquidity threshold is a configurable field.

### `[Fix]` Braiins rejection-ratio chart no longer freezes at ~33% (#51)

The Hashrate chart's Braiins rejection line divided by the adjacent-point Δpurchased with no minimum; a handful of cleared shares between counter syncs produced a wild ratio (e.g. 1 reject / 3 cleared = 33%) that then carried forward and "stuck". A measurement now requires a minimum cleared-share delta (accumulating the interval until it's statistically meaningful), so the line stays on the true ~1% rate.

### `[Note]` Deferred to a later build (#51 remainder, #50)

A separate NiceHash-delivered line on the Hashrate chart and an Ocean-derived effective-rejection figure for NiceHash are deferred - they add under-testable aggregation plumbing and a new derived metric better validated against live data. NiceHash delivered speed is already surfaced numerically (AVG NICEHASH tile, provider card, provider-aware hero). #50 was investigate-only: the AVG NICEHASH vs AVG OCEAN gap is expected - they measure different things (NiceHash's matched/accepted speed vs Ocean's lagged 5-min received hashrate net of routing/rejection).

## 2026-07-25 (consolidated NiceHash fixes)

### `[Release]` v1.18.12

Consolidated build folding the fill-line hotfix together with a refill-threshold fix, a dust-floor default, and a fill-line readout on the Provider panel. Supersedes the un-deployed 1.18.11.

### `[Fix]` Refill threshold now uses spendable (fee-adjusted) remaining

The refill decision compared the order's remaining against the threshold, but computed remaining from the gross `amount` (0.002 BTC) minus spend, rather than the fee-adjusted `availableAmount` (what's actually spendable, ~7k sats less). So the daemon's remaining read ~7,000 sats higher than NiceHash's own "remaining", the threshold never tripped, and top-ups didn't fire while the order quietly drained. Remaining is now `availableAmount - payedAmount`, matching NiceHash's UI, so refills fire at the configured threshold.

### `[Improvement]` Provider panel shows the raw fill line

The "NiceHash price" tile now also shows the underlying fill line (before overpay), so the fill line / target / order price can be reconciled against the NiceHash order book at a glance.

### `[Improvement]` Dust-floor default raised to 0.1 PH/s

`nicehash_min_delivered_ph` now defaults to 0.1 (was 0) so a tiny trickle order can't anchor the fill line below where real supply sits. (Phantom orders with zero miners are ignored regardless.)

## 2026-07-25 (fill-line hotfix, folded into 1.18.12)

### `[Release]` v1.18.11

Hotfix: the NiceHash order could sit priced below the real fill line and deliver nothing. Root cause was the fill-line anchor - it picked the cheapest order receiving ANY hashrate, even when that order was only catching a trickle while the real supply sat at a higher price.

### `[Fix]` Depth-aware NiceHash fill line (no more stranded orders)

The daemon anchored the NiceHash bid to `lowestFillingPrice` - the cheapest order in the book receiving any hashrate above the dust floor. On the live book that was a cheap order catching only a trickle, while the actual ~1.4 EH/s of supply sat higher at 0.4820. So the daemon targeted too low and the order, priced below the true fill line, delivered 0.00 PH/s. Raising the dust floor didn't help because the trickle was above it. The fill line is now DEPTH-AWARE: it anchors to the cheapest price whose cumulative delivered supply (from the bottom of the book up) covers our target hashrate - i.e. where enough real supply exists to fill our whole order - so the daemon prices to actually deliver. Falls back to the old cheapest-any-fill rule only when no target is configured.

### `[Fix]` Refill now fires at the configured threshold (remaining was over-stated)

The daemon computed a NiceHash order's remaining budget as `amount - payedAmount`, using the GROSS order size. NiceHash deducts its fee up front, so the spendable budget is `availableAmount` (amount minus the ~3% setup/refill fee), and its own UI shows remaining = `availableAmount - payedAmount`. The daemon therefore read remaining ~7,000 sats too high and never crossed the refill threshold - e.g. it saw 0.00035 remaining (above a 0.0003 threshold) while the real remaining was 0.00028 (below it), so the top-up never fired. Remaining is now computed from `availableAmount`, matching NiceHash, so refills trigger exactly at the configured threshold. (Operators should also set the NiceHash fee % in config - typically 3 - so the ~3% marketplace fee is folded into the provider-switch comparison; the submitted bid is unchanged.)

### `[Fix]` Phantom orders (speed with zero miners) no longer set the fill line

The live order book routinely lists cheap orders showing an `acceptedSpeed` while having ZERO assigned miners (`rigsCount = 0`) - stale/settling entries that aren't actually receiving hashrate. The daemon counted their reported speed as real supply, which anchored the fill line to a price that delivers nothing. Orders with no miners are now treated as delivering zero, so only genuinely-served supply sets the fill line. Combined with the depth-aware anchor, the daemon prices against the real market instead of the cheapest phantom entry.

## 2026-07-25 (later)

### `[Release]` v1.18.10

NiceHash order-tracking fixes found while running live. The daemon could not raise a NiceHash order's price - every increase was silently rejected - so when the fill line rose the order fell below it and stopped delivering (0.00 PH/s) until it was raised by hand. Root cause: submitted prices weren't quantized to NiceHash's 4-decimal tick. Also folds in the uniform Braiins park (no cancel on switch-away), a smarter edit cadence that stops churning NiceHash's 10-minute lockout, a restart that starts on only the favorable provider, and the BIDS panel showing both providers at once.

### `[Fix]` NiceHash price edits no longer rejected for too many decimals (error 2997)

Every price the daemon submitted came straight from its sat/PH/day maths, which routinely produced five decimal places in NiceHash's BTC/EH/day unit (e.g. 48,199 sat/PH/day -> 0.48199). NiceHash accepts at most four decimals and rejected the rest with error 2997 - so increases (and any decrease that didn't happen to land on a round value) silently failed, leaving the order stranded below the fill line and delivering nothing. Submitted prices are now rounded to NiceHash's 0.0001 tick (10 sat/PH/day) on both CREATE and EDIT, so every mutation is accepted.

### `[Fix]` Increases no longer churn the 10-minute decrease lockout

On NiceHash every price change - increases included - starts a 10-minute window during which the price can't be decreased. The daemon re-targeted fill-line + overpay every tick, firing a tiny increase whenever the fill line ticked up and thereby permanently resetting that window, so it could never lower the price when the market fell. It now holds an increase while the order is still above the fill line (delivering on the overpay cushion) and only raises once the price has fallen to the fill line, then jumps straight back to target for fresh headroom. Decreases likewise skip sub-cap nudges so a cooldown is never spent on a trivial move.

### `[Fix]` Braiins is parked, not cancelled, on a provider switch (uniform handover)

Switching to NiceHash cancelled the Braiins bid, but a freshly-created Braiins bid can't be cancelled during its 10-minute grace period, so it kept spending. The Braiins side now parks (drops the bid below the fill line) exactly like NiceHash - a decrease isn't grace-blocked, so spend stops immediately, and the bid stays alive for a free instant raise on switch-back. Cancel is reserved for hard stops (stratum down, teardown).

### `[Fix]` A restart starts on only the favorable provider

On boot the daemon now commits straight to whichever provider is cheaper right now, bypassing the sustained-switch window (a restart has no incumbent to protect). This prevents it briefly placing a Braiins bid while a NiceHash order is already live.

### `[Improvement]` BIDS panel shows the Braiins bid and NiceHash order together

During a handover both can be live at once; the panel previously showed the NiceHash order only when there were no Braiins bids. It now shows both.

## 2026-07-25

### `[Release]` v1.18.9

NiceHash price-tracking fix. The daemon could not lower a NiceHash order's price at all - every attempt was rejected by NiceHash with error 5063 "Order price change is too big" - so an order left overpriced as the fill line dropped just kept spending. This release fixes the decrease logic, respects NiceHash's exact cooldown, and surfaces that cooldown in the Next Action card. Also folds in the persisted active-provider fix (a restart while NiceHash was active no longer places a throwaway Braiins bid).

### `[Fix]` NiceHash price decreases no longer rejected as "too big" (error 5063)

NiceHash caps how far an order's price can be lowered in a single edit (about 200 sat/PH/day == 0.002 BTC/EH/day for this SHA-256 market), and rejects anything larger. The daemon treated that 200 figure as a *minimum* step and snapped each decrease UP to the largest whole multiple at or above the target - so tracking a fill line several hundred sat below the order produced one oversized drop (600, 800, or more) that NiceHash refused every tick, leaving the price stuck. The decrease logic is inverted to the correct semantics: take at most one cap-sized step toward the target per edit and walk the price down over successive cooldown windows. Increases remain instant and unrestricted.

### `[Fix]` NiceHash decrease cooldown is read exactly from NiceHash and shown in Next Action

NiceHash allows one price decrease per 10 minutes and, on a too-soon attempt, reports the precise seconds remaining ("Seconds till available: N") - the only place that number is exposed, since the order object carries no last-change timestamp. The daemon now parses that value to gate its own decreases (so it stops retrying blindly) and, crucially, to stay in sync when the *operator* lowers the price manually, which resets NiceHash's server-side timer. The remaining cooldown is displayed in the dashboard's Next Action card so you can see exactly when the next lower can land.

### `[Fix]` Active provider persists across a restart

A restart while NiceHash was the active provider reset the in-memory selection to Braiins, which placed a throwaway Braiins bid on the first tick that then couldn't be cancelled during Braiins' creation grace period - briefly running both providers. The active provider is now persisted (migration 0123) and resumed on boot, so a restart picks up on NiceHash with no stray Braiins bid.

## 2026-07-19

### `[Fix]` Remove the misleading "Telegram 2FA tap required" note from bid-create

The Timeline note stamped on every bid creation claimed a Telegram 2FA tap was required. That's not true for the way the autopilot places bids: it uses the account owner token via Braiins' API, which does not need the Telegram confirmation (that confirmation is part of Braiins' web interface). The note is dropped so it no longer implies an action you have to take.

### `[Fix]` Daemon no longer crashes when the Electrum connection drops mid-session

The Electrum (electrs/Fulcrum) client dropped its socket's error handler right after connecting, so if the Electrum server restarted or dropped an idle connection while the daemon was mid-request - common during a payout backfill, or when Umbrel's Electrs app bounces - the next write hit a broken pipe with no listener and Node escalated it to an uncaughtException ("write EPIPE"), crashing the whole daemon (systemd then restarted it). The socket now keeps a persistent error handler for its whole life: a dropped connection cleanly fails the in-flight Electrum calls (already treated as best-effort, retried next tick with a fresh connection) instead of taking the process down.

## 2026-07-17

### `[Release]` v1.17.3

Bug-fix release. Deduced Lightning payouts recorded the full pre-drop unpaid balance rather than the actual balance decrease, over-counting a partial sweep where Ocean leaves a freshly-credited block unpaid (#343, diagnosed by regenerous); the amount is now the decrease, multi-step drops fold into one payout, and already-stored amounts self-correct on the next scan. Also fixes the Bitaxe miners card ignoring the number-format locale (#347).

### `[Fix]` Deduced Lightning payouts no longer overcount a partial sweep (#343)

A deduced Lightning payout recorded the full unpaid balance from just before the drop as its amount. That over-counts whenever Ocean credits a freshly found block and then pays out only the older balance, leaving that new credit unpaid: the payout is the balance decrease, not the whole pre-drop reading (diagnosed by regenerous). The daemon now records the decrease (pre-drop minus the residual left behind), a multi-step drop folds into one payout spanning the whole group, and already-stored deduced amounts self-correct on the next scan - no hard reset needed.

## 2026-07-16

### `[Fix]` Bitaxe miners card respects the number-format locale (#347)

The Bitaxe card formatted every value with a hard-coded period decimal (hashrate, power, rejection rate, efficiency, temperatures, best difficulty), so operators with comma-decimal locales saw "1.02 TH/s" on the card next to a stats bar correctly saying "1,02". All card values now go through the locale-aware formatter, and best difficulty is re-formatted from its exact numeric so its decimal separator matches too.

## 2026-07-15

### `[Release]` v1.17.2

Focused follow-up to v1.17.0/1.17.1's Lightning P&L work. Ocean's payout API turns out not to report Lightning payouts at all (confirmed by Ocean support), so the daemon now deduces them from confirmed drops of unpaid earnings to zero with no matching ledger entry (#343) - history backfilled on upgrade, deduced records superseded automatically if the real settlement ever appears, ghost gems + explanatory tooltips on the chart. Also fixes Timeline notes being erased by the P&L hard reset (#346).

### `[Fix]` Timeline notes survive the P&L hard reset (#343, #336)

The hard reset rebuilds the payout store by deleting and re-fetching every payout, which gave each one a new internal id - and Timeline notes are attached to those ids, so every note on a payout silently vanished. Notes are now snapshotted before the wipe and re-attached to the rebuilt payouts afterwards (matched by their stable identity), a note on a payout that doesn't come back is kept rather than destroyed, and a deduced payout that gets replaced by the real ledger record passes its note along to the replacement.

### `[Feature]` Lightning payouts are deduced from unpaid earnings - P&L "collected" no longer misses them (#343)

Ocean's payout API turns out not to report Lightning payouts at all (confirmed by Ocean support), so operators paid over Lightning saw a too-low "collected" figure and an inflated loss rate. The daemon now deduces those payouts: a confirmed sharp drop of your unpaid earnings to zero (two consecutive readings, so a brief API glitch can't fake one) with no matching entry in Ocean's ledger is recorded as a deduced payout - first as "type not known yet" for 24 hours (a late-arriving on-chain record replaces it automatically), then as "probably Lightning". Historical drops are backfilled on upgrade, deduced records survive the P&L rebuild/hard-reset controls, and if Ocean's API ever starts reporting Lightning payouts the real records take over seamlessly. On the chart, deduced payouts render as a ghost gem (dashed outline) whose tooltip explains the deduction and marks the amount as approximate.

### `[Release]` v1.17.1

Feature + polish release since v1.17.0. New: a current-block-height stats tile that names the pool/miner and crowns your own blocks (#335); personal notes on Timeline events (#336); a full-text Timeline search across id, reason, notes, and identifiers (#342); a Profit & Loss "hard reset" control (#343). Improved: the alert-condition drawer breaks an outage into threshold / fired / recovered / duration / total with nearest-unit rounding (#341, #340); the P&L "collected" figure self-heals from a partial payout backfill (#343). Fixes: DDNS test push sends the daemon's detected IP (#339). Infra: @fastify/static v10, @fastify/cors, and dev-tooling bumps (#344, #345). Umbrel gallery screenshots refreshed.

### `[Infra]` Dependency bumps: @fastify/static v10, @fastify/cors, dev tooling (#344, #345)

Merged the grouped Dependabot updates. `@fastify/static` went from 9 to 10 (major): its `setHeaders` callback now receives a Fastify reply instead of the raw Node response, so the dashboard's HTML no-cache headers were updated to `reply.header(...)`; static asset serving and the immutable-asset/no-cache-HTML behavior are unchanged. Also `@fastify/cors` 11.2 to 11.3, and dev-only bumps (eslint, prettier, tsx, typescript-eslint, vite). No user-visible behavior change.

### `[UI]` Durations round to the nearest unit instead of truncating (#341)

Duration labels (alert drawer total, chart tooltips, "was open for Xm") rounded down: a 15m56s total showed "15m" even though the recovery text correctly said "was zero for 16m". Durations now round to the nearest displayed unit - 30s and up rounds a minute up - so the numbers match and no longer read a whole minute short.

### `[UI]` Alert drawer shows threshold + duration + total, not just the fire window (#341)

An alert-condition drawer used to show a single "Duration" that was really the window from the loud alert *firing* to recovery (e.g. "56s") - misleadingly small when the underlying problem lasted far longer (the alert fires only after a sustained threshold). The drawer now breaks it into rows: the threshold waited out before firing, when the alert fired, when it recovered, the alert duration, and a **total condition time** (onset to recovery) - the number you actually care about. When the firing row recorded the exact onset, these are exact; for older rows that predate onset-recording, the threshold and total are estimated from your current alert settings and marked with `≈` plus a footnote, since historical config changes aren't stored. No stored data is changed - this is purely how the drawer reads it.

### `[UI]` Timeline pool-block drawer numbers and units line up in columns (#340)

Follow-up to the unit sweep: numbers in the block/payout/deposit drawer now right-align to a shared edge with the unit (Satoshi glyph, `%`, `T`) in its own fixed column to the right, so both the digits and the units line up straight down regardless of how wide each value is.

### `[UI]` Timeline drawer units muted + aligned for % and difficulty (#340)

Continuing the unit-consistency sweep: the pool-block drawer's share-log `%` and the difficulty-retarget drawer's `T` and `%` now render in the same muted grey, space-separated style as the Satoshi glyph, so numbers and units line up down the column. The difficulty and change also follow your number format now (they were using a period decimal regardless of locale).

### `[UI]` P&L rebuild/hard-reset move to the lifetime card + confirm what they did (#343)

The "rebuild" and "hard reset" controls now live on the Profit & Loss **lifetime** card, where the data they rebuild (collected + spent) actually is, instead of the per-day card. And they now confirm the outcome: after running, a short line reports how many payouts were pulled and the resulting collected total (e.g. "hard reset done · 604 payouts · collected 0,0188 ₿"), so you're not left guessing whether it finished.

### `[Feature]` Profit & Loss "hard reset" button (#343)

Next to "rebuild" on the Profit & Loss panel there's now a "hard reset" - the nuclear option. Where "rebuild" re-fetches and fills gaps, "hard reset" DELETES the stored Ocean payout history and the Braiins spend cache outright and rebuilds both from scratch, so nothing stale can survive. It's safe: the payout wipe is fetch-before-delete (an Ocean outage aborts it and leaves your data intact), re-pulled payouts are marked already-notified so it won't re-alert you about old ones, and no other data references the payout store. The "collected" figure briefly shows 0 while it re-pulls. Use it only if "rebuild" didn't resolve a wrong figure.

### `[Fix]` Timeline search finds CREATE rows by their bid id (#342)

The new Timeline search returned nothing when you searched a bid id and had the Action filter narrowed to "create" only. A CREATE event is recorded before Braiins echoes back the order id, so its stored id is null and the id shown on the row is forward-filled from the next event. The search matched the raw (null) column instead of that forward-filled id, so creates were unfindable by id. It now matches the effective id, so searching a bid id surfaces its create too.

### `[Fix]` Profit & Loss "collected" self-heals when the payout store is incomplete (#343)

The P&L "collected" figure comes from a local store of Ocean's earnpay payout history. That store was full-backfilled exactly once (only when empty), so if that single fetch ever came back partial - a transient Ocean hiccup during the upgrade would do it - collected stayed permanently short, inflating the loss rate (one operator jumped from ~7% to ~32%), with no way to recover. The daemon now re-runs the full backfill periodically (and on every restart), which re-fetches the complete history and fills any gaps - a full earnpay fetch returns everything, and re-storing rows you already have is a no-op, so it's safe. The Profit & Loss "rebuild" button now also forces this payout re-fetch (not just the spend cache), for an instant fix. Unpaid earnings and spend were never affected.

### `[Feature]` Timeline "Bid id" box is now a smart full-text search (#342)

The Timeline's "Bid id contains" filter is now a general "Search" box that matches, case-insensitively, across the bid id, the Reason text, your personal note on the row, and the identifiers a row shows (block height/hash, IP addresses, deposit tx ids, config-change values). It searches your entire history, not just the loaded rows: the daemon matches reason + note (via the event-notes join), so a hit in an old row that hasn't paged in yet still surfaces. The merged extra rows (blocks, payouts, IP changes, difficulty retargets, config changes, alerts) are filtered client-side against their summary + identifiers + note. It ANDs with the type chips and date range as before. The free-text term is now a bound SQL parameter with LIKE-wildcard escaping.

## 2026-07-12

### `[Fix]` Alert duration now reflects the true outage window (#341)

An alert's detail drawer showed a "Duration" that contradicted its own body - e.g. Duration `56s` under a body reading "was zero for 16m", or Duration `30m` next to "unreachable for 5m". The cause: alerts fire only after a sustained-threshold delay, so the span was measured from the fire time, not from when the condition actually went bad. The daemon now stamps the condition-onset on the firing alert, and the Timeline span (its row position, duration badge, detail-drawer Started/Recovered/Duration, and chart band) covers the full outage from onset to recovery - so Duration matches the recovery body. The alert row's own timestamp stays the fire time for delivery and Alerts-list ordering. Applies to newly-fired alerts; historical alerts keep their previous behaviour.

### `[UI]` Consistent number/unit/colour formatting across Timeline drawers (#340)

Swept a batch of formatting inconsistencies in the event detail drawers. The Pool Block drawer's height now carries a thousand separator (`957.746`, not `957746`). Units are uniformly muted-grey with the Satoshi glyph: the CREATE drawer's speed (`PH/s`) and budget (sat) rows, the block-reward/subsidy/fee/earnings rows, and the Edit-speed dialog all match the rate rows now, instead of baking a full-intensity unit into the number. The Edit-price `delta` is sign-coloured - green when it drops (you pay less), red when it rises (you pay more) - like the rest of the app. The Mode-change drawer shows localized run-mode labels (`Dry Run → Live`) instead of the raw enum keys (`DRY_RUN → LIVE`). Percentages (share log) follow the configured number format too.

### `[Fix]` DDNS "Test connection" pushes the box's real IP, not the request's source (#339)

The DDNS Test connection button did a real provider update but omitted the IP parameter (`myip=` for No-IP/dyndns2, `ip=` for DuckDNS). Per those protocols, when the IP is left out the provider records the source IP of the update request - so testing while a machine on the path was connected to a VPN wrote the VPN exit IP to the hostname, pointing your pool URL at the wrong place. The test now sends the daemon's own detected public IP explicitly, exactly like the periodic updater, so a test can only ever assert the box's real IP (and harmlessly returns `nochg` when it already matches).

### `[UI]` Block-height tile names the pool from a curated database (#335)

The block-height tile used a heuristic on the raw coinbase to name the pool, which mangled real tags - Foundry's coinbase reads "(/Foundry USA Pool #dropgold/", so the tile showed a stray "(", the "#dropgold" slogan as a fake "worker", and wrapped over three lines. It now identifies the pool the same way every block explorer does: the daemon bundles mempool's curated pool database and matches the coinbase output address (or a known coinbase tag) to the canonical name - so the tile reads a clean "Foundry USA" on one line. The worker line (with the corrected hard-hat icon) now appears only for Ocean and your own blocks, where the coinbase carries a genuine per-miner identity; public pools show just the pool name. The database ships in the image and can be refreshed from upstream without a code change.

### `[UI]` Wider Timeline detail drawers on large screens (#338)

The Timeline detail drawers (bid event, alert-condition span, and the log-extra drawer) were fixed at ~24rem, so Bitcoin addresses and transaction IDs wrapped and dropped their trailing characters even with empty space to spare. They now widen with the viewport (up to 40rem on extra-large screens) while staying full-width on mobile, so long identifiers fit on one line.

### `[Fix]` Timeline now shows events that happen while the page is open (#337)

The Timeline's merged event sources (daemon boots, payouts, pool blocks, alerts, deposits, difficulty retargets) used to freeze at the moment you opened the page - anything that happened afterwards only appeared after a manual reload. The daemon was recording everything correctly; the frontend had captured its window's end time once at page-load and never advanced it. A run of restarts, for example, would stop adding boot rows even though each restart was logged. The window's live edge now advances with every background refresh, so new events flow in on their own (and "following" mode works as intended again).

### `[Feature]` Add your own notes to Timeline events (#336)

Every event in the Timeline now has an optional note. Open any event's detail drawer and there's a text field where you can jot a personal note ("wired funds here", "switched pools", "this is the outage I was chasing") - it saves automatically when you click away, and clearing it removes it. Notes work on every event type (payouts, deposits, pool blocks, IP changes, retargets, config changes, boots, bid actions, and alert conditions) and are included as a "Note" column in the Excel export.

## 2026-07-11

### `[Feature]` New "block height" stats tile, crowned when you found the block (#335)

There's a new pickable stat tile showing the current Bitcoin block height. Clicking it opens that block in your configured block explorer in a new tab. Its caption names the pool that found the current tip (tidied toward the clean name, so "Powered by Luxor" reads "Luxor") plus the miner when the coinbase carries one. The caption splits the coinbase into the pool and the worker on two lines, each with its own icon (waves for the pool, hard-hat for the worker) - e.g. "ViaBTC" over "wmklasson". A leading icon mirrors the chart's pool-block markers and honors your Chart-colors settings: a gold crown (with a gold number) only when *you* found the block, a BIP 110 cube when the tip signals, a blue cube for any other Ocean block, and a muted grey cube otherwise. The tile needs a Bitcoin node (it reads the tip's coinbase and header from bitcoind), so it hides itself entirely on installs without one. Add it from the stats-bar tile picker. The daemon polls the tip each minute and only re-reads the full block when the height changes, so it's cheap.

### `[Fix]` Timeline colors now follow your Chart colors settings (#334)

The Timeline used to draw its row glyphs with the built-in default colors, ignoring any customizations you made in Config → Display & Logging → Chart colors. So a recolored marker showed correctly on the charts but not in the Timeline - which is exactly why a real Braiins deposit didn't jump out. Now every Timeline color resolves through your overrides: the deposit / payout / pool-block / IP-change / difficulty-retarget rows, the bid-event action glyphs (create / edit / cancel / mode change / paused / resumed), and the alert-condition rows and their pop-ups all match the chart. Colors with no configurable key (config-change, daemon-boot, generic alerts) are unchanged. This also corrects a pre-existing mismatch where the "bid paused" glyph was amber in the Timeline but rose on the chart.

### `[UI]` Hashrate-chart tooltip units are dimmed to match the Price tooltip

The Hashrate chart's tooltip now renders its units (`PH/s`, and the `×` on pool luck, `%`, `°C`, etc. on the right axis) in the same muted grey as the Price tooltip and the stat tiles, so every chart readout is consistent - the unit sits at lower intensity than the number.

### `[UI]` Price-chart tooltip units use the Satoshi glyph and follow the currency toggle

The Price chart's hover/pinned tooltip now renders its rate units with the Satoshi symbol instead of the word "sat" (e.g. `47.104 ꜱ/PH/day`), styled in the same muted grey as the stat tiles so the unit reads at lower intensity than the number. The right-axis readout drops the unit from its label - the row now just says "unpaid" (or "paid total", "lifetime", etc.) and carries the unit as a dimmed glyph on the value instead. All of it follows the global sats/BTC/USD toggle: the Satoshi glyph in sats, ₿ in BTC, and $ amounts in USD.

### `[Feature]` Change your password and rotate Braiins tokens from the dashboard (#332)

Config → Pool & Payout now has a Security & credentials section. On installs whose secrets live in the database (the Umbrel/appliance path, where there's no shell or SOPS), you can change your dashboard password and rotate your Braiins owner and read-only tokens right from the browser. Changing the password takes effect immediately: the new one works on your next click and the old one stops instantly, which also boots anyone still holding it. A new token is test-called against Braiins before it's saved, so a typo can't silently break bidding; token rotations apply after the next daemon restart. Every change asks for your current password first. On env/SOPS installs the section shows a read-only notice pointing you to where those secrets are actually defined, rather than offering an editor that a reboot would quietly overwrite.

## 2026-07-07

### `[Fix]` Security: DB-stored secrets are now encrypted at rest (#331)

The credentials the daemon has to keep usable (Braiins tokens, bitcoind RPC password, Telegram token, DDNS credential) are now stored AES-256-GCM-encrypted in the database instead of plaintext, so a copied `state.db` or an app-data backup no longer hands over your secrets. The encryption key comes from `BHA_SECRET_KEY` if set (on Umbrel that's the device-derived `APP_SEED`, which lives outside the app's data folder), otherwise a generated key file next to the database. Existing installs encrypt in place on the next daemon start. If the key is ever lost the daemon degrades gracefully (treats the secret as unset and prompts you to re-enter it) rather than crash-looping. This does not - and by design cannot - protect against someone who already controls the running machine; it protects the data-leaves-the-box cases. Completes the GHSA-wvpp hardening. See `docs/security-secrets-at-rest.md` for the full threat model.

### `[Fix]` Security: credential fields are now write-only in the API (#331)

The config API used to return your saved Telegram bot token, bitcoind RPC password, and DDNS credential in full to any logged-in dashboard session. It now blanks those on read and treats a blank value on save as "keep the existing one," so the raw secrets never leave the daemon. The Config screen shows "leave blank to keep saved value" on those fields. Usernames and node URLs stay visible since they aren't secrets. Part of the GHSA-wvpp hardening.

### `[Fix]` Security: the dashboard password is now stored as a hash, not plaintext (#331)

The dashboard password is only ever checked, never recovered, so it's now stored as a one-way scrypt hash instead of plaintext in the database. Even someone who reads `state.db` can no longer recover the password itself (which matters because passwords get reused). Existing installs are upgraded automatically on the next daemon start, and operators who supply the password via environment variable / SOPS are unaffected. Part of the GHSA-wvpp hardening.

### `[Fix]` Chart no longer shows a stale "bid paused" band after a paused bid is cancelled

A paused-bid band on the Hashrate and Price charts only ended when the bid resumed. But when a bid is paused and then cancelled (for example the stop-spend protection cancelling after a Datum outage, then creating a fresh bid), it never resumes, so the band ran to "now" and made the new, active, delivering bid look paused. The band now also closes when the paused bid is cancelled or replaced by a new bid, so it reflects the real paused window only.

### `[Fix]` Security: credential values are no longer stored or shown in the config-change audit log (GHSA-x8x9)

Saving config in v1.16.0 recorded the raw old/new value of every changed field into the Timeline's system-events log, including credentials (Telegram bot token, bitcoind RPC user/password, DDNS username/credential). Those values were then reachable through the dashboard API, the Timeline, and the Excel export. The daemon now redacts these credential fields at write time - it still records that the field changed, just never the value - and a migration scrubs any values v1.16.0 already stored, so upgrading removes them from existing databases. Non-credential fields (payout address, node URL, hostnames) stay visible, since seeing those change is useful audit signal. Thanks to the reporter for the detailed writeup.

## 2026-07-06

### `[UI]` Config-change timeline entries for layout/color changes are now readable

Changes to dashboard tiles, card order, muted alerts, and chart colors used to dump the raw JSON arrays in the timeline row and detail panel (`["uptime","pool_luck_24h",...] → [...]`). They now show a friendly semantic diff: the detail panel lists `+ Added` / `− Removed` items with their real names (or "Reordered · N items" when only the order changed), and chart-color changes show a color swatch and hex per series. The timeline row shows a compact summary like "Dashboard tiles changed (1 replaced)". Numeric/toggle config changes were already readable and are unchanged.

### `[UI]` Pool blocks 30d tile is colored by pool luck

The POOL BLOCKS 30D stat tile was always neutral, but a raw block count only means something relative to what's expected. It now colors by the 30-day pool luck (actual ÷ expected): green at or above par (>=1.0), amber in the 0.9-1.0 approach, red below 0.9.

### `[UI]` Wallet runway tile turns amber later - a two-week runway is green now

The WALLET RUNWAY stat tile now colors green at 3+ days (matching the default runway alert threshold), amber between 1 and 3 days, and red under a day. The previous 7/14-day thresholds painted a comfortable multi-week runway amber, which looked like a warning when nothing was wrong.

### `[Fix]` Timeline shows earnpay payouts and the payout gem "View in timeline" jump highlights again (#323)

The Timeline's payout rows now come from the same Ocean payout ledger (earnpay) as the Price chart's gems, so Lightning payouts appear in the Timeline too and a gem's "View in timeline" link highlights the matching row again. After the chart gems were repointed to the ledger, their row keys no longer matched the Timeline's on-chain-scanner rows, so the jump landed on nothing. Payout rows and the detail drawer are now rail-aware (on-chain vs Lightning; the transaction link and block-height row are shown only for on-chain payouts).

## 2026-07-05

### `[UI]` Price-chart payout gems now include Lightning payouts (#323)

The payout markers on the Price chart come from Ocean's own payout ledger (earnpay) instead of the on-chain address scanner, so Lightning payouts finally appear on the timeline. On-chain gems keep their block-explorer link; Lightning gems show a "LIGHTNING PAYOUT" tooltip with no link (there's no on-chain transaction to open). Because the source no longer depends on an Electrum/Bitcoin node, operators without one now see their payout gems too. The legend label is now just "payout" since it covers both rails.

### `[Fix]` "Payout confirmed" Telegram alert now fires for Lightning payouts too (#323)

The second-stage "Ocean payout confirmed" notification used to come from the on-chain scanner, so a Lightning payout - which never touches the blockchain - never produced a confirmation message (only the rail-blind "payout initiated" heads-up). It now fires from Ocean's own payout ledger and states whether each payout settled on-chain or over Lightning. The alert's config label lost its "on-chain" qualifier accordingly. Existing payout history is baselined silently on first run so upgrading doesn't replay old payouts to your phone.

### `[Feature]` Profit & Loss now counts Lightning payouts, with an on-chain vs Lightning split (#323)

"Collected" in the Profit & Loss panel now comes from Ocean's own payout ledger (the earnpay endpoint) instead of the on-chain address scanner, so Lightning payouts finally count. Previously a Lightning payout dropped your unpaid-earnings but never showed up as collected, so net P&L silently understated by the full payout. When you have both rails, the panel shows the split ("on-chain X, Lightning Y"). Collected also no longer needs an Electrum/Bitcoin node configured - it works from your Ocean payout address alone. If you had set the manual pre-installation offset to compensate for missed Lightning payouts, the panel now flags that it may double-count so you can review it.

### `[Infra]` Ocean earnpay payout store (groundwork for Lightning-aware P&L) (#323)

Adds a daemon-internal sync of Ocean's authoritative payout list (the `/v1/earnpay` endpoint) into a new `ocean_payouts` table, covering both on-chain and Lightning settlements. It backfills the full history on first run for a payout address and refreshes a trailing window on a slow cadence. No user-visible change yet; this is the source of truth that the P&L "collected" figure and the chart payout gems switch onto in following commits, so Lightning payouts stop being invisible to accounting.

### `[Fix]` Hero auto-fit uses real grid items so iPad Safari constrains the width (#325)

Follow-up on the iPad hero clipping. The two hero columns were laid out with a Tooltip wrapper as the direct grid item, and its `display: contents` mis-sizes the grid track on iOS Safari - so the auto-fit measured a column wider than what actually rendered and never shrank, clipping the value on device while every headless engine measured it correctly. The columns are now real constrained `<div>` grid items. A temporary `?fitdebug=1` readout was added to surface the measured widths on-device.

### `[Fix]` Hero price/delivered no longer clip the last digit on iPad Safari (#325)

The auto-fitting hero values could measure their width before the text finished laying out on iOS Safari, compute that no shrinking was needed, and then overflow once the real width materialised - clipping the last digit and pushing the +/- spread badge out of view. The auto-fit now re-measures when the content itself resizes (not only when the column does), so the right scale is applied as soon as the true width is known, and iOS text auto-inflation is disabled. Desktop was unaffected. Reproduced and fixed against the WebKit (Safari) engine.

## 2026-07-04

### `[Feature]` Pinch-to-zoom on charts for touch devices (#324)

On iPad and iPhone you can now pinch the Hashrate and Price charts to zoom the time axis: spread two fingers to zoom in, bring them together to zoom out, anchored under the pinch midpoint. Zoom was previously mouse-wheel only, so touch devices could pan but not zoom.

### `[Fix]` "Payout initiated" alert no longer promises an on-chain confirmation (#323)

This alert fires when Ocean debits your unpaid balance, which is an off-chain signal that doesn't reveal whether the payout went out on-chain or via Lightning. It previously said "on-chain confirmation follows; you'll get a second message when the transaction lands" - a promise that never came true for Lightning payouts. It now simply states it reflects Ocean's own report of the debit, without claiming what happens next.

### `[UI]` BTC amounts drop trailing zeros; hero values never clip the last digit

BTC-denominated rates were padded to a fixed eight decimals, so the hero price and the avg-cost-vs-hashprice tile showed noise like "0,48108000" and "0,00921000". They now strip the trailing zeros ("0,48108", "0,00921") while still expanding to full satoshi precision for tiny values. Also tightened the hero auto-fit so a scaled value keeps a small margin from the column edge - the delivered number could otherwise lose its last digit to a one-pixel rounding clip in some unit combinations.

### `[UI]` Hero price/delivered card looks right in every unit combination

The big PRICE and DELIVERED numbers at the top of the Status page kept a fixed font size, so long values in some unit combinations overflowed and collided - USD in EH mode ("$30.259,60"), BTC in PH mode ("0,00048252"), and the spread badge that sits next to the price. The two numbers now auto-fit their columns and share one size, so any combination of hashrate unit (TH/PH/EH) and denomination (sats/BTC/USD) stays on one clean line with the values matched. Also fixed the spread badge showing a stray "/TH/day" (or "/EH/day") tail in USD mode - it only stripped the "/PH/day" form before.

### `[UI]` All six default stat tiles fit one row on iPad

On an iPad Pro in portrait the sixth tile (avg cost vs hashprice) wrapped onto a lonely second row. The tiles now shrink slightly so all six fit across one row at that width; wider screens are unchanged and narrower ones still reflow.

### `[Fix]` Pool-block tooltip is fully interactive on touch, with a Timeline jump

Tapping a pool-block marker on an iPad opened the tooltip in its hover state - no close button, no "View in timeline" jump, and the block-explorer link wasn't tappable - because iOS treats the first tap on a hover-revealing marker as a hover, not a click. A tap now pins the tooltip directly, so the full interactive panel (dismiss, block explorer, and the Timeline jump) is available on the first tap. Desktop click behavior is unchanged.

### `[Perf]` Small chart pans reuse cached data instead of refetching

Releasing a chart pan snapped the fetch window to a fixed 5-second grid, so even a tiny nudge produced a brand-new data request across five queries. The snap now scales with the visible span (about 1% of it), so small back-and-forth pans land on the same cached window and render instantly. The chart itself still draws at exact pixel positions - the snap only affects what gets fetched.

### `[Perf]` One shared clock for ticking labels, snappier chart jumps, calmer catch-up refetches

All per-second countdowns and "updated Xs ago" labels now share a single clock instead of each running its own timer, so their updates land in one render batch. Jumping from the Timeline to a chart marker (and back) scrolls immediately when the target is already on screen instead of waiting for the first poll tick. And the "refreshing…" catch-up loop stops hammering the API after ~20 seconds if the daemon doesn't come back, falling back to the normal poll interval.

### `[Perf]` Smoother chart panning: heavy math no longer re-runs per drag frame

Dragging a chart re-ran the price chart's full effective-rate accumulation (a nested loop over up to a million point-pair combinations) on every frame of the drag, because it lived in the same computation block as the viewport-dependent scales. It now only recomputes when new data actually arrives. The pool-luck block markers also swap a linear scan per block for a binary search, shaving another chunk off chart rebuilds when a luck axis is selected.

### `[Perf]` Fewer duplicate requests: shared query cache and calmer refocus behavior

The Timeline page fetched the Ocean, payout and deposit data under its own cache keys, so with it open the same endpoints were polled twice concurrently. It now shares one cache with the rest of the app. Queries also get a 15-second freshness window, so returning to the tab or switching pages refetches only data that has actually had a chance to change instead of refiring every query at once. The Config page additionally stops re-serializing the whole config three times per keystroke for its unsaved-changes check.

### `[Perf]` Faster dashboard loads: compressed API responses and cached Ocean assembly

All API responses over 2 KB are now gzip-compressed - the chart data endpoint returns multi-MB JSON that compresses about 10x, which is most of the chart load time on remote connections. The Ocean panel endpoint also stops re-running hundreds of database lookups on every poll: the assembled response is cached until the upstream Ocean snapshot refreshes. Two smaller cuts: the metrics endpoint no longer re-queries the first-tick timestamp per request, and the finance endpoint no longer fetches the lifetime-spend snapshot twice.

### `[Perf]` Chart crosshair no longer re-renders the whole Status page per pointer move

The shared crosshair position lived in Status-page React state, so every hover tick re-rendered the entire page - tiles, pipeline cards and both full chart SVGs - just to move a vertical line. The position now lives in a small subscription store; only the crosshair line, dots, value readout and the alert-band marker fade-in re-render as the pointer moves. Behaviour is unchanged: synced hover across both charts, click-to-pin, Esc/outside-click dismissal, touch long-press scrub.

### `[Perf]` Status page stops re-rendering the charts on every hover and poll tick

Both charts are wrapped in React.memo, but several props (pointer handlers, solo-mining arrays, event-kind filters, inline callbacks) got a fresh identity on every Status render, so the memo never hit and the heaviest chart transforms recomputed at pointer-move frequency. Those props are now referentially stable, Intl.NumberFormat instances are cached instead of rebuilt per axis label, the tiles bar and chart marker layers only re-render when their data changes, and the locale context no longer invalidates all consumers on unrelated renders. Hovering, panning and live polling on the Status page now do a fraction of the work per frame.

## 2026-07-03

### `[Release]` v1.16.0

The Timeline release. One unified chronological event log (bid actions, alert spans with recovery rows, payouts, deposits, all pool blocks, retargets, IP changes, config edits, daemon restarts) with bidirectional chart jumps and sonar beacons; streaming denomination-aware Excel export with no row cap; follow live-tail; daemon-started chart markers; fully denomination-aware values everywhere including rewritten reason text. Controller safety: the #319 duplicate-bid guard and the stratum-probe datum-down cancel. Exact TIDES credits in pool-block alerts (#321). Migration 0115. Docs audited to spec v2.17 with a fresh screenshot set.

### `[UI]` Unpaid-line block dots explain the balance step

Clicking a dot on the unpaid-earnings (or lifetime-earnings) line showed only the pool-block tooltip - block reward, share, explorer link - but nothing about the thing the dot actually sits on: your balance. The tooltip now adds a "unpaid balance at this step" section with before, after, and the credited delta as Ocean observed it. The top-edge block cubes (which aren't balance events) keep the plain block tooltip.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner: reward and fees always show 8 decimals

The block table stripped trailing zeros from the BTC amounts, so every row had a different width (3.132358 next to 3.13594278) and the reward/fees columns were hard to scan. Both now always render the full 8 decimals.

### `[Feature]` Timeline: alert recoveries are rows too (#322)

When an alert condition heals (hashrate back above floor, DATUM reachable again, ...), the Timeline now shows a second row at the recovery moment - emerald check glyph, "below floor resolved", with the recovery message ("Hashrate back at or above floor - was below for 17m") in the Reason column. Previously only the opening row existed and the recovery left no trace in the feed. Recovery rows toggle with the same condition chip as their opening row (no extra filter) and are included in the Excel export. Spans closed implicitly (a next episode, or a stale orphan bound) have no real recovery moment and get no fabricated row. Clicking a recovery row opens a recovery-flavored drawer (emerald "resolved" header, the recovery message), and its "View on chart" jumps to the band's closing edge and pulses the beacon there - not at the onset. The two log-only condition classes (marketplace empty, bid paused sustained) draw no chart band of their own - the fillable-gap and bid-pause hatches already cover them - so their jump used to land on nothing; they now get a beacon-plus-guide-line anchor on the price chart at the jumped-to moment.

## 2026-07-02

### `[Fix]` Pool-block-credited alert reports the exact credit, not the ~ estimate

The "Credited to you" number in the pool-block Telegram/alert was falling back to the `~share × reward` estimate (consistently ~1% high) whenever the daemon had restarted since the previous block - which during active development was nearly always. The alert already waits for Ocean's unpaid balance to include the credit before firing, so the exact number was always available at that moment: it now uses the unpaid delta against the block's own noticing-time baseline, which needs no memory of any previous alert. The `~` estimate remains only for genuine unknowns (multiple blocks in one tick, or the payout-block failsafe where unpaid went down instead of up).

### `[UI]` Timeline: all filters are now sticky; follow live-tails every source

The Alerts and Events chip groups and the follow toggle now persist per browser like the rest of the toolbar filters (they used to reset to "all on"/off on every reload). And while following, the merged sources (payouts, deposits, blocks, IP changes, retargets, alerts, system events) poll at the same 15 s as the bid feed, so a fresh payout no longer lags up to a minute behind the rows around it.

### `[Fix]` Config-layer cleanup from the code-vs-spec audit

Three small config fixes. The dynamic hashprice cap's schema default now matches what fresh installs actually get (2,000,000 sat/EH/day, cap ON - the Zod default said "disabled" while first-run seeding enabled it; existing installs keep whatever they have, including an explicit "disabled"). The dead `handover_window_minutes` field is dropped (migration 0115) - it belonged to a manual-override system that was retired before it ever shipped. And `BHA_WALLET_RUNWAY_ALERT_DAYS` now accepts fractional days (e.g. `0.5`) via environment variable, matching what the dashboard and docs always allowed.

### `[Fix]` Datum-down auto-cancel now keys on the stratum probe, not the optional stats API

The stop-spend rule (cancel all bids after 3 consecutive ticks of Datum being unreachable, #199) was reading the optional Datum stats-API poller instead of the mandatory stratum TCP probe. Two failure modes fixed: with no stats API configured the protection could never fire during a real stratum outage, and a stats-API-only glitch (healthy share path) cancelled every bid. Found in a code-vs-spec audit; the spec always said "stratum".

## 2026-07-01

### `[UI]` "Daemon started" markers on the price chart (bidirectional jump)

Daemon restarts now show up as an always-visible power-glyph marker on the price chart (emerald, with a dashed guide line), the same idiom as the run-mode / pause / resume markers. Clicking one opens a small tooltip with the build/version and a "View in timeline" jump; and the reverse - the Timeline's "daemon started" row now has a "View on chart" button that pans there and pulses the marker. So a restart that explains a gap is reachable from either view, closing the last event kind that only jumped one way.

### `[UI]` Timeline rate units use the Satoshi glyph + a fixed second line

The Timeline's rate column headers now put the unit on its own second line ("Fillable" then "(≡/PH/day)") instead of wrapping at an arbitrary spot, and the word "sat" is replaced by the Satoshi glyph in the headers, the Δ-price filter label, and the reason text - shorter, cleaner, and consistent with the rest of the dashboard. The Excel export keeps the plain "sat" wording (a font glyph can't render in a spreadsheet).

### `[UI]` Reason text respects the display denomination

The last raw-unit holdout: bid-event Reason lines (e.g. "track fillable: 48,288 sat/PH/day → 47,817 sat/PH/day") are generated by the daemon in canonical sat/PH/day and PH/s. They now get their numeric+unit tokens rewritten into the active denomination wherever the reason appears (Timeline table, detail drawer, chart tooltip, and the Excel export), so the sentence reads in the same units as the columns beside it (e.g. "0.48288000 ₿/EH/day → 0.47817000 ₿/EH/day"). The surrounding audit wording is untouched, and any token the daemon might word differently in future is left as-is rather than mangled.

### `[UI]` Clearer filter controls + a spinning export indicator

The bulk filter controls now read as controls: each group's "all · none" is a segmented button pair (bordered pills) instead of faint gray text that didn't look clickable, and the global control is two plain "select all" / "select none" buttons in the toolbar cluster (reset stays alongside). The export button now shows a spinning loader while it works instead of a "…", so it's obvious something is happening.

### `[UI]` Timeline: global "Filters all · none" toggle

Next to the reset button there's now a global **all · none** that flips every chip in all three filter groups (Actions, Alerts, Events) at once - a quick way to start from "everything" or "nothing" and then pick. Reset stays as the full reset (also clears the text/date filters).

### `[UI]` Timeline "follow" (live tail) button

A **follow** toggle in the timeline toolbar tails the feed live: it refetches faster and, as new events land, keeps you pinned to the newest ones (only when you're already near the top, so scrolling down to read isn't interrupted). Turning it on jumps to the live edge. Click again to stop.

### `[UI]` Chart event tooltip respects the display denomination

The price-chart marker tooltip (click a bid event on the chart) was the last surface still printing price / fillable / hashprice / overpay / max bid / effective cap / deadband in raw sat/PH/day. It now follows the units toggle like everything else, with the unit muted beside each value.

### `[UI]` Timeline table + bid-event detail respect the display denomination

The on-screen Timeline was still showing Fillable, Price before/after and Δ price in raw sat/PH/day regardless of the units toggle (only the Excel export and the Speed column had been converted). Those columns now follow the active denomination, with the unit shown once in each column header (e.g. "Fillable (BTC/EH/day)") and the numbers bare below. The bid-event detail drawer (click a row) gets the same treatment across all its rate rows (price, delta, fillable, hashprice, overpay, max bid, effective cap), plus budget and speed.

### `[UI]` Excel export respects the display denomination; faster to open

The exported spreadsheet now honours the global units toggle: with EH + BTC selected (for example), fillable/prices/Δ and speed are written in BTC/EH/day and EH/s instead of always sat/PH/day and PH/s, and each column header spells out its unit (e.g. "Fillable (BTC/EH/day)", "Speed (EH/s)"). Decimals follow the denomination too, so speed now carries the same precision as the dashboard (e.g. "3.00 PH/s") rather than rounding to a whole number. Columns use fixed widths instead of Excel's best-fit auto-sizing, which had to rescan every cell when the file opened - noticeably slow on large (20k+ row) exports.

### `[UI]` Timeline: "payout initiated" no longer looks like an alarm; reset re-enables everything; localized export

Grab-bag of timeline fixes. "Payout initiated" was drawn with the alarm bell in alert-amber, which read as a problem - it now uses a payout (hand-coins) glyph in payout green, since it's good news. The **reset** button now re-enables every filter group (Actions, Alerts, and Events), not just the actions. And the Excel export now follows the interface language (headers + sheet tab translated to nl/es; the values were already localized).

### `[UI]` Filter chips show their real icons; "View in block explorer" button on on-chain events

The Alerts and Events filter chips now carry the same glyph as their timeline rows instead of a generic colored dot - so the daemon-started chip shows the power icon (and is finally recognizable as its filter), payout shows the gem, deposit the fuel pump, alerts the warning triangle, and so on. And on-chain events (payout, deposit, pool block) get a proper **"View in block explorer"** button next to "View on chart" in the detail panel, replacing the small text link.

### `[UI]` Mode-change gets its own icon so it stops colliding with daemon-started

The "mode" action and the "daemon started" event both drew the Lucide power icon, so the mode filter chip looked like it might be a daemon-started filter. Mode-change now uses a distinct left-right arrow (⇄) everywhere - timeline rows + filter chip, chart markers, and the Config color swatch - leaving the power icon to mean daemon-started. (The daemon-started filter already lives in the Events row.)

### `[UI]` Richer timeline detail panels: build on daemon-start, human-readable config changes, explorer links

Three improvements to the timeline side panels: a **daemon started** row now shows the build that launched (e.g. `build 721 · v1.15.1 · abc1234`). A **config change** now reads in plain language and your chosen hashrate unit - `max_overpay_vs_hashprice_sat_per_eh_day: 2000000 -> 1500000` becomes "Max overpay vs hashprice: 2,000 → 1,500 sat/PH/day". And **deposit / payout / pool-block** panels now carry an "open in block explorer" link. (The daemon-start build detail only appears for boots after this update.)

### `[Perf]` Timeline export is now streaming, with no row cap (#320)

Replaced the Excel writer (exceljs, which held every cell in memory and forced the 200k-row cap) with a streaming one built on fflate: the worksheet is written and compressed row-by-row, so memory stays flat regardless of size - it runs comfortably on the light hardware Hashrate Autopilot targets. The row cap is gone. The Excel library also shrank from ~930 kB to ~8 kB.

### `[Fix]` Autopilot no longer places a duplicate bid on a bid-list fetch blip (#319)

When the Braiins bid-list read transiently failed (or momentarily didn't include our bid) while the orderbook read succeeded, the decision loop saw "no owned bids" and created a **second** bid, which its own "multiple owned bids" guard then cancelled a few minutes later - wasting a little hashrate spend and showing a confusing extra `create` in the Timeline. The create path now waits unless the bid-list fetch definitively succeeded AND the local ledger agrees there are no live bids, mirroring the caution already applied to ledger pruning. Strictly conservative: it can only prevent spurious creates.

### `[UI]` "View in timeline" links + reveal resets filters when the target is hidden

The chart tooltips' jump links now say "View/Show in timeline" (the page is the Timeline now, not "history"). And when you jump from a chart marker to a bid-event row that a filter is currently hiding - e.g. you'd turned "price" off, then clicked a price marker's "Show in timeline" - the Timeline now clears the filters that would keep that row from loading, so the reveal always lands on the row instead of silently going nowhere.

### `[Feature]` Export the Timeline to a formatted Excel file (#320)

An **export** button in the Timeline toolbar downloads every row matching the active filters as a formatted `.xlsx` (bold/frozen header, autofilter, column widths). It pages the bid-event feed to completion and merges in the payout / deposit / block / IP / retarget / alert / config / daemon-start rows within the active date range and group toggles - not just what's on screen. Very large pulls are capped at the most recent 200,000 bid events (a memory guard, not an Excel limit) with a heads-up to narrow the date range. The Excel library loads only when you click export, so it never weighs down the normal page.

### `[UI]` Timeline detail panel mirrors the chart tooltip; long hashes are copyable

Clicking a log row now opens a panel showing the same information the event's chart tooltip shows, instead of a bare summary. A pool block lists height, pool reward, subsidy, fees, your estimated share, and the BIP-110 signal - and the long block hash is now a small copyable value with a copy button rather than a wall of digits. Payout, deposit, IP-change and retarget rows get their structured detail too (txid / address are copyable).

### `[Fix]` Timeline Action filter now hides what you deselect (opt-out)

The Action chips were opt-in - selecting one showed *only* that kind, and deselecting everything showed *everything* - which is the opposite of the Alerts and Events groups and confused the operator: clicking "price" off didn't hide the price rows. All three groups now behave the same: every chip is on by default, and clicking one hides that kind. The Action group also gets its own "all · none" toggle, and deselecting every action now correctly shows no bid rows (previously it fell back to showing all). Fixed a latent bug where reloading dropped MODE_CHANGE / bid-paused / bid-resumed from a saved filter.

### `[UI]` Timeline filter groups get "all · none" quick toggles

The Alerts and Events filter groups now have a compact "all · none" control next to their label, so isolating a single event type (e.g. only `create`) is a couple of clicks instead of deselecting a dozen chips one by one.

### `[UI]` Timeline polish: renamed, columns reordered, filter fields on one row, real reset button

The History page is now called **Timeline** (nav tab + heading), since it's a unified log of every event, not just orders. The **Action** column moves ahead of **Bid** so the most useful column shows first - especially on mobile, where the long bid id used to hog the second slot. The filter toolbar's text/date fields (Bid id, From, To, Δ price) now share one dedicated row instead of Δ price sitting alone, and **reset** is a real amber button rather than a faint text link.

### `[UI]` Universal sonar beacon when jumping from a log row to its chart marker (#318)

Completes the graph <-> log round-trip: every event in the History log now pulses a sonar beacon on its chart marker when you click "View on chart" in the detail panel - not just pool blocks. Payout (gem), deposit (fuel), IP-change (router), and difficulty-retarget (pickaxe) markers each get the ping, and the "payout initiated" alert homes in on the matching unpaid-drop marker on the price chart. So from either direction - marker popup "View in history", or log row "View on chart" - you land on the counterpart with a beacon showing exactly which one. (The unpaid-drop marker only exists when the price chart's right axis is set to unpaid or lifetime earnings; the others beacon regardless of axis.)

### `[UI]` History log rows open a detail panel instead of jumping straight to the chart (#318)

Clicking a log entry (payout, deposit, pool block, IP change, retarget, alert, config change, daemon start) now opens a slide-over detail panel - matching how bid events and alert-condition rows already behave - instead of immediately panning the chart. The panel shows the event time and details, plus a "View on chart" button that does the jump (blocks still pulse the sonar beacon on their cube/crown; config and daemon-start events have no chart marker, so they show details only). Per-marker sonar beacons for the remaining marker types are a follow-up.

### `[UI]` Pool-block log rows: crown/blue/yellow icons, reveal beacon, "View in history" for every block (#318)

Follow-up to the unified log. Pool-block rows in the History log now use the same marker language as the chart: a gold crown for our own block, a blue cube for other miners' blocks, and a yellow cube for BIP-110-signalling blocks (previously every block row was a plain yellow cube). Clicking a block row now pulses a sonar beacon on the matching cube/crown on the hashrate chart when it jumps there (it just panned before, with no way to tell which cube). And a block's chart tooltip now offers "View in history" for every block, not only our own.

### `[UI]` One shared "alert condition" marker color instead of six (#318)

The six per-condition alert-band colors (below floor, zero hashrate, DATUM unreachable, marketplace API, wallet runway, Bitaxe overheating) are consolidated into a single **alert condition** color that tints every alert-condition band and its onset/recovery markers - the band label already tells you which condition it is. The setting moves from its own "Alert condition bands" group into the **Markers** section of Config -> Display -> Chart colors. Any custom color you'd set on one of the old rows carries over to the shared slot.

### `[Feature]` Complete unified log: every alert type, config changes, daemon restarts (#318)

Continuing the "one log of everything relevant" direction. The History tab now also shows: every remaining Telegram alert as a row (payout-initiated, Bitaxe best-difficulty, fee/beta-exit, plus any future alert class automatically - excluding ones already shown as a span or from a dedicated source); `marketplace_empty` and `sustained_paused` as log-only span rows (no extra chart band); **config changes, one row per changed field** (e.g. `max_bid: 49000 -> 50000`), recorded on save; and a **"daemon started"** row on every boot (so a restart shows even when the run mode didn't change). Config/boot events are stored in a new `system_events` table (migration 0114) and served by `/api/system-events`. The payout-initiated (unpaid-drop) dot on the price chart gains a "View in history" link that jumps the log to that time. Each new kind has a filter chip.

### `[Feature]` Difficulty retargets in the History log (#317)

Difficulty-retarget events (the pickaxe markers) now appear as rows in the History log, with a "View in history" link on their chart tooltip - so you can jump from a retarget marker to its log row like the other events. A new `/api/retargets` endpoint derives them server-side from the per-tick network-difficulty epochs (a >0.5% jump = retarget, the same threshold the chart uses). Pool-luck step markers are intentionally left out of the log - they're too frequent to be log-worthy.

### `[UI]` Alert band onset/recovery markers reveal on cursor proximity (#317)

The little down/up triangles that mark where a condition band starts and ends are now hidden by default - the chart just shows the hatch bands - and fade in only near the cursor, so they don't clutter the chart but are right there (and clickable) when you reach for one. The jumped-to (focused) span's markers always show. Bands themselves are unchanged.

### `[UI]` Config color rows show the real marker icon; "View in history" on every event popup (#317)

The six alert-condition color rows in Config -> Display -> Chart colors now show the actual marker glyph (the filled down-triangle the chart draws at a condition's onset) instead of a plain swatch, so they're recognizable next to the other marker rows. And the speed-edit marker popup on the hashrate chart gained a "View in history" link, so now every clickable chart popup that maps to a log row - bid events, alerts, payouts, deposits, blocks, IP changes, speed edits - can jump to its row. Those jumps also use the efficient date-window jump for old events.

### `[Fix]` "View in history" lands on the row in context, even for old events (#317)

Revealing a weeks-old event (e.g. a payout from 6 days ago) used to scroll to a row floating far below the live feed, where it drifted as more bid pages loaded - effectively unreachable. The reveal link now carries the event's timestamp and, when the event is well in the past, jumps the History feed's date window to around it (the feed loads the ~100 bid rows from that period rather than thousands from now). The target row lands in the viewport with surrounding context. Reset the date filter to return to the live feed.

### `[Feature]` History becomes a unified event log with "View in history" from every marker (#317)

The History tab now folds in the other notable account events as rows alongside bids and alerts: on-chain payouts, Braiins deposits, blocks your pool found, and public-IP changes - each with its own glyph, color, and an "Events" filter chip. And every clickable chart marker's pinned tooltip gains a "View in history" link that jumps to the matching row in the log and briefly highlights it, even if the event is weeks old (the row is surfaced on demand). This extends the chart-to-log jump you liked on the alert markers to the whole chart.

### `[UI]` Alert chart markers open a pinned pop-up with "View in history" (#316)

Clicking an alert onset/recovery marker on a chart now pins a small pop-up at the marker - the same interaction language as the other chart markers (pool blocks, IP changes) - instead of the full slide-over drawer (which stays for the History rows). The pop-up shows the condition, severity, started/recovered/duration and body, and its action is "View in history" (you're already on the chart), which jumps to and briefly highlights the matching row on the History page.

### `[UI]` Alert chart markers are clickable; focus beacon auto-clears (#316)

Two follow-ups from operator feedback. Clicking an onset or recovery marker on a chart band now opens the same alert detail drawer as the History rows (it had no info dialog before), with a generous click target over the small glyph. And the jump-to-chart focus beacon now auto-clears after ~6 seconds like the bid-event beacon, instead of pulsing for a full minute and re-appearing on every later zoom/pan of that span.

### `[UI]` Alert timeline polish: detail drawer, onset/recovery markers, focus beacon (#316)

Follow-up to the alerts-on-timeline work, from operator feedback. Clicking an alert row in History now slides out a detail drawer (like bid events) showing the condition, severity, when it started and recovered, the duration, and the full alert body, with a "View on chart" button. On the charts, each condition band now carries a small triangle marker at the top - a filled down-triangle at the onset and a hollow up-triangle at the recovery ("above floor again") - so even a few-minutes span is visible and you can see exactly when it cleared. Jumping from a History alert row pulses a sonar beacon on the band so you can spot what you landed on. History also auto-loads a few more pages on open so a recent alert just past the first page surfaces without manual scrolling.

### `[Feature]` Alerted conditions now show as bands on the charts (#316)

Sustained alert conditions - delivered hashrate below floor, zero hashrate, DATUM or marketplace-API unreachable, low wallet runway, Bitaxe overheating - used to live only in the Alerts tab, disconnected from the timeline. They now render as hatched background bands on the charts over the exact period each condition was open, with a dashed onset line and a hover tooltip naming the condition and its duration. Hashrate-shaped conditions band the Hashrate chart (where the floor line is); connectivity ones band both charts. Each condition has its own color. Orphan conditions - an opener with no recovery, e.g. left by a daemon restart mid-condition - are bounded (closed at the next episode of the same condition, or capped) so a stale weeks-old alert can't tile the whole chart.

### `[Feature]` Alerts now appear as rows in the History timeline (#316)

The second half of unifying alerts into the timeline: the History tab now interleaves alerted condition spans as rows, so a sustained problem sits in the same chronological feed as the bid activity around it. Each alert row shows the condition glyph + label (tinted to match its chart band), its duration or "ongoing", and the alert body in the Reason column; clicking it pans the price chart to when it started. A new "Alerts" chip group in the toolbar toggles each condition on or off. The six band colors are configurable under Config -> chart colors ("Alert condition bands"). Strings are translated to nl/es.

### `[UI]` History filter toolbar laid out properly on mobile

On a phone the Order History filter bar was a mess: the Action chips overflowed past the right edge of the card, and because the controls just wrapped in source order the From and To date fields ended up split across different rows in an illogical position, with the reset button stranded mid-bar. The toolbar is now mobile-first - Action chips wrap inside the card, Bid id and Δ price go full-width, From and To sit side-by-side as a single date-range row, and reset moves to its own right-aligned row at the bottom. The desktop layout is unchanged (the date pair dissolves back into the inline flow above the `sm` breakpoint).

## 2026-06-28

### `[Release]` v1.15.1

Patch release: fixes and polish, no new headline features. The price chart's safety-ceiling line is relabeled "effective cap" and is now historically accurate - the "max premium over hashprice" knob is recorded per tick and backfilled for older history, so tuning it only moves the line from that point forward (#312). Invalid Bitcoin payout addresses are now rejected at save (#309), preventing silently lost earnings from a typo. The P&L "Per Day" card no longer sticks on "refreshing…" (#311), the DATUM stats API gives actionable errors when behind an auth proxy or on a moved port (#310), and the Electrum host/port help points to the server's own connection page (#313). Plus the IP-change tooltip relative-age, mobile tiles-bar overlap (#302), block-explorer preset both-URLs (#301), and corrected Ocean batched-sweep payout wording throughout.

## 2026-06-28

### `[Fix]` Backfill the effective-cap line's historical premium (#312 follow-up)

The #312 fix historized "max premium over hashprice" per tick going forward, but left every row recorded before that migration NULL - and the chart falls back to the *current* config value for NULL rows, so all of your pre-existing history still chased the live knob (exactly the bug #312 was meant to kill, only fixed from the migration forward). Lowering the premium still dragged the whole back-history down with it. Migration 0113 backfills that leading NULL block with the earliest premium the daemon actually recorded - the value in effect when per-tick recording began - carried backward over the old history. We can't know the true premium for ticks that predate recording (it was never stored), so this freezes the unknown past at a concrete historical value instead of letting it follow the current setting. Future knob changes now only move the line from the change forward. No-op if you never enabled the dynamic cap.

## 2026-06-28

### `[Fix]` P&L per-day card no longer stuck on "refreshing…" (#311)

The Profit & Loss per-day card's refresh countdown was derived from `data.checked_at_ms`, which the finance API sets to the *oldest* of its aggregated source timestamps - so whenever any source was even slightly stale, `checked_at_ms + 60s` was already in the past and the card sat on "refreshing…" forever instead of counting down like the other cards. The countdown now derives from react-query's actual fetch time (`dataUpdatedAt + 60s`) and self-heals at zero, matching the rest of the dashboard.

## 2026-06-28

### `[Fix]` Effective-cap line on the Price chart is now historically accurate (#312)

The red line on the Price chart is the effective cap, `min(max bid, hashprice + max premium over hashprice)`. Max bid was already stored per tick, but the premium was applied as the *current* config value across the whole history - so changing "Max premium over hashprice" shifted the entire line, including the past, making it look like you'd always had the new value. The premium is now historized per tick (migration 0112), exactly like max bid, so the line reflects what the premium actually was at each moment and tuning the knob only affects ticks from the change forward. Pre-migration history falls back to the current value (we can't know the past premium). The line is also relabeled from "max bid" to "effective cap" since that's what it actually plots.

## 2026-06-28

### `[UI]` Electrum host/port help points to the server's connection page (#313)

The "Electrum server host" / "Port" fields used a terse "Default 50001." hint, which left users unsure what to enter (the autopilot works with electrs, Fulcrum, or ElectrumX). The help now simply points to the authoritative source: read the host and port off your Electrum server's own connection page - the same applies whichever implementation you run, on Umbrel, Docker, Start9, or bare metal - and notes that a fresh Umbrel install auto-fills these for the Electrum server you chose at setup, so you usually don't need to touch them. No per-implementation presets or port specifics, since the right values are environment-specific and the connection page is the one place that always shows them. (#273 follow-up.)

## 2026-06-28

### `[Fix]` Clearer DATUM error when it's behind an auth proxy or its port moved (#310)

When the DATUM stats API is unreachable, the panel and the "Test connection" button used to show unhelpful errors: a bare `fetch failed` (port gone), or `Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON` (the request silently followed Umbrel's app-proxy 302 into a login page). The daemon now detects a redirect-to-login ("the Datum API is behind an auth proxy ... see docs/setup-datum-api.md"), an HTML response served with a 200, and rewrites connection-refused into "the port may have changed or a manual port mapping was reverted by an app update". `docs/setup-datum-api.md` is refreshed too: it now leads with the fact that Datum app updates revert the manual port mapping (the actual recurring failure mode), and documents the cleaner `PROXY_AUTH_ADD: "false"` / `PROXY_AUTH_WHITELIST` approach alongside the original direct-mapping method.

## 2026-06-27

### `[Fix]` Validate the BTC payout address (#309)

The BTC payout address field accepted any non-empty string. A stray `c` got saved, the worker identity became `c.plebs-pilot`, and because Ocean credits by the address in the worker identity, the rented hashrate was credited to nobody - silent lost earnings, plus a blank Ocean panel and a frozen unpaid-earnings line. The field now validates as a real mainnet Bitcoin address (bech32 `bc1q…` or Taproot `bc1p…`) in the Config form, the first-run wizard, and the config-save API. An invalid address shows an inline error, isn't saved, and blocks the save. Validation is write-side only, so an already-saved bad value can't prevent the daemon from starting before you fix it.

## 2026-06-25

### `[Infra]` Dependency bumps: Babel 8, @types/node 26, typescript-eslint 8.62, actions/checkout v7 (#303-#306)

Applied four Dependabot updates, all dev/build tooling or CI (no runtime bundle change): @babel/core 7.29.7 → 8.0.1, @types/node 25.9.3 → 26.0.0, typescript-eslint 8.61.1 → 8.62.0, and actions/checkout 6 → 7 in the CI workflows. The two majors were verified end to end: Babel 8 transforms the lingui macros cleanly (full build + dev-server check), and @types/node 26 passes the typecheck. Tests and dev smoke green; no behavior changes.

## 2026-06-22

### `[Fix]` Tiles bar "add tile" no longer overlaps the range selector on mobile (#302)

On narrow screens the "add tile / pick…" control - anchored as a floating element above the tiles - overlapped the time-range buttons (3h / 6h / … / All) that sit directly above it, because the two blocks are closer together than the float's upward offset. On desktop the selector's right side is empty so it never collided. The control now floats in the top-right corner only from the `sm` breakpoint up; below that it flows as a right-aligned row beneath the tiles, so there's no overlap on phones.

### `[Fix]` Block-explorer preset now sets both URLs in one click (#301)

Clicking a block-explorer preset (mempool.guide, mempool.space, etc.) wrote only the Transaction URL template, leaving the Block URL template unchanged. The Config draft updater spread a stale snapshot, so the two writes a preset fires in one click landed in the same React batch and the second clobbered the first. The updater now uses a functional `setState`, so the writes compose - both URLs update together, for every preset.

## 2026-06-18

### `[Infra]` Dependency bumps: lingui 6.4, better-sqlite3 12.11.1, react-router 7.18, + tooling (#297, #300)

Applied both grouped Dependabot updates: production deps (better-sqlite3 12.10.0 → 12.11.1, @lingui/core + @lingui/react 6.2.0 → 6.4.0, react-router-dom 7.17.0 → 7.18.0) and dev/tooling deps (the rest of @lingui/* 6.4.0, tailwindcss + @tailwindcss/vite 4.3.1, vitest 4.1.9, eslint 10.5.0, playwright 1.61.0, prettier 3.8.4, typescript-eslint 8.61.1, @types/node 25.9.3). Verified with a full workspace build, the i18n catalog recompile, the test suite, and a dev-server smoke check; no behavior changes.

## 2026-06-17

### `[Fix]` Two CodeQL findings: support-bundle escaping + a no-op string replace

Fixed two static-analysis alerts. The Diagnostics support bundle's markdown table escaped `|` in a probe detail/error but not a leading backslash (and didn't collapse newlines), so a detail containing `\` or a multi-line error could break the table rendering; it now escapes backslashes first and flattens newlines. Separately, a leftover `whereClause.replace(/\be\./g, 'e.')` in the bid-events history query was a no-op (it replaced `e.` with itself) and is removed; the SQL it produced is byte-identical, so query behavior is unchanged.

### `[UI]` Correct the Ocean payout-mechanism wording (it's a batched sweep, not a coinbase)

Several tooltips and docs claimed Ocean pays you "in the coinbase of the next block Ocean finds." That's wrong: Ocean accumulates block rewards in a pool wallet and settles operator payouts as batched, multi-output transactions broadcast on its own cadence, mined into whatever block by whatever pool (not a coinbase, not necessarily an Ocean-mined block). The "next payout" tooltip on Status, the two payout-alert tooltips, and the historical-backfill tooltip on Config are reworded to match reality, and docs/spec.md + docs/research.md are corrected (the backfill code already matched any tx paying the address since #240). Translations updated for en/nl/es.

## 2026-06-16

### `[Infra]` pnpm v11 compatibility: settings + native-build approval in pnpm-workspace.yaml (#299)

pnpm v11 stopped reading the `pnpm` field from `package.json`, which meant the build-script approvals (better-sqlite3, esbuild) and the dependency overrides (the esbuild / js-yaml / fast-uri security pins) were silently ignored on v11 - and `pnpm install` printed a warning on every update. Those settings now live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, where both our pinned pnpm v10 and pnpm v11 read them. pnpm v11 also changed how native builds are approved: `onlyBuiltDependencies` (which v10 uses) is no longer honored for approval and a fresh v11 install hard-errors with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, so the workspace file now also carries an `allowBuilds` block (v11's mechanism) with both keys present - a clean install builds better-sqlite3's native binding on either pnpm major. The lockfile is unchanged, so frozen-lockfile installs are unaffected.

### `[UI]` IP-change marker tooltip shows relative time

The public-IP-change marker tooltip on the charts now shows a relative age in parentheses after the absolute timestamp (e.g. "15 Jun 2026, 12:22:28 (12h 24m ago)"), so you can tell at a glance how long ago an ISP rotation happened without doing the math.

## 2026-06-15

### `[Infra]` Pin js-yaml to 4.2.0 (clears Dependabot advisory)

Pin js-yaml `>=4.2.0` via a pnpm override to clear a medium Dependabot advisory (quadratic-complexity DoS in YAML merge-key handling). The dependency is dev-only - it rides in through `openapi-typescript`, a build-time codegen tool, and is never in the runtime image, so there is no production exposure. No runtime behavior change.

### `[Release]` v1.15.0

Aviator branding (favicon, header logo, and app icon), the bid-vs-hashprice stats tile (#293), mempool.guide as the default block explorer plus mempool.kilombino.com as a second BIP-110-aware option (#289), reachable-but-not-hashing detection for Bitaxe miners (#291), and a sweep of fixes: stale-bid self-heal (#295), false bid-paused bands (#292), the cross-browser chart-jump beacon (#288), the year-long HTML cache, and daemon-offline downtime accounting. Safe to upgrade from any 1.14.x release.

### `[UI]` "View on chart" in the History event drawer is now a button

The "View on chart" action in a History event's detail drawer was a faint amber text link buried in the footer and easy to miss. It's now a filled amber button placed near the top of the drawer, right under the event reason, so jumping from an event to its spot on the price chart is an obvious, prominent action you reach for first. "copy JSON" stays a subtle secondary control in the footer.

### `[UI]` App icon is now the aviator brand mark (#298)

The Umbrel / app-store icon (`assets/icon.webp` + the 512/256 PNGs) is replaced with the aviator brand mark - vintage orange on navy, matching the new favicon and header logo - so the browser tab, in-app header, and store/home-screen tile share one identity. The old icon was an unrelated illustration that turned to mush at small sizes. The Community App Store picks it up via the existing URL; the official Umbrel store icon updates with the v1.15.0 PR.

### `[Fix]` Self-heal local bids that were deleted at Braiins out-of-band (#295)

If a bid was removed at Braiins while the autopilot wasn't looking (the operator cancelled it manually, a port/URL change, etc.), the local ledger kept it as active forever - the stale-URL banner showed a ghost bid and "Cancel & recreate" failed because the order no longer existed, leaving the only fix as hand-editing the database. Now the daemon cross-checks the ledger against a successful Braiins bid-list fetch each tick and clears any active bid the list no longer contains (with a grace window so a freshly-placed bid is never pruned, and only when the fetch definitively succeeded so an API hiccup can't wipe live bids). "Cancel & recreate" also recovers on its own: an "order not found" from Braiins is treated as already-gone and clears the row. No manual database surgery, no stuck loop.

### `[UI]` Add mempool.kilombino.com as a second BIP-110 block explorer

A second BIP-110-aware mempool instance, mempool.kilombino.com, joins the block-explorer presets, highlighted in yellow next to mempool.guide. Selecting it sets both the block and transaction URL templates.

## 2026-06-14

### `[UI]` Aviator favicon and header logo

The dashboard now has a stylized 1940s aviator (leather flight helmet + goggles, vintage orange): a favicon in the browser tab (orange on a navy tile, 16/32/48 + apple-touch 180) and a transparent badge of the full aviator next to the "Hashrate Autopilot" wordmark in the top bar. Favicon links and a theme-color meta were added to `index.html`.

### `[Infra]` Bump esbuild to 0.28.1 (clears GHSA advisories)

Pin esbuild `>=0.28.1` via a pnpm override to clear two Dependabot advisories (one high - a Deno-path RCE via `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`, which doesn't apply to our Node/Vite usage but shouldn't ride along on a release; one low - the Windows dev-server file read). Build and tests unaffected. No runtime behavior change.

### `[UI]` mempool.guide is now the default block explorer (#289 follow-up)

mempool.guide - a mempool.space fork that surfaces BIP-110 miner signaling - is now the default block/transaction explorer for fresh installs and the first preset in Config → Display & Logging → Block explorer, rendered as a highlighted yellow "preferred" pill with a tooltip explaining the BIP-110 rationale. Existing installs keep whatever explorer they configured; only the default and the preset order/styling change.

## 2026-06-13

### `[Feature]` Bid-vs-hashprice tile shows how close you are to cheap mode (#293)

A new add-tile catalogue entry, BID VS HASHPRICE, shows the price the controller would post (fillable ask + overpay) as a percentage of Ocean hashprice - the exact quantity cheap mode checks. The caption is state-aware: the cheap threshold ("cheap < 95%") when above it, sustained-window progress ("3/5 min < 95%") while it's filling below the threshold, and "cheap on → 10 PH/s" once cheap mode engages, with emerald / amber / neutral colouring to match. The percentage and the cheap-mode window summary are computed daemon-side (`/api/status` `cheap_status`) so the tile can't drift from the controller's own check. Opt in via the tile picker.

### `[Fix]` Solo miners no longer show phantom hashrate after a halt; no false "back online" (#291)

A Bitaxe-family miner that thermally halts but stays reachable keeps publishing its last hashrate - the NerdAxe firmware exposes no halt flag and does not zero the reading - so the Bitaxe miners card looked healthy and a false "miner back online" alert fired while nothing was hashing. HA now detects a reachable-but-not-hashing miner: it reads the explicit `overheat_mode` (stock Bitaxe) and `shutdown` (NerdQAxe) flags where the firmware provides them, and otherwise catches a physically impossible hashrate-per-watt reading. A halted miner now shows 0 with a "reboot needed" badge, drops out of the fleet hashrate total, and the zero-hashrate alert keeps firing (no false recovery) until it is genuinely hashing again.

### `[Fix]` Bid-pause bands no longer falsely shade long spans as paused (#292)

Large red hatched "Bid paused by Braiins" bands were shading long stretches (e.g. "1d 15h") where the bid was clearly delivering hashrate. Cause: when the bid was paused while the daemon was down or restarting, the daemon re-baselined as paused without recording the pause, then emitted a lone `BID_RESUMED` on resume - and the dashboard rendered that orphan resume as "paused since the beginning of time", shading the whole history. Now the daemon only emits a resume when it logged the matching pause, and the dashboard draws no band for an orphan resume it can't place on a timeline. The genuine pauses still shade correctly.

### `[Fix]` Chart-jump beacon now shows in Firefox and Safari; jump homes in to a 3 h window (#288)

The History → chart "homing beacon" was invisible in Firefox and Safari - it animated the SVG `r` attribute via CSS, which only Chrome/Blink supports, so the rings stayed at radius 0 elsewhere. The sonar rings now animate `transform: scale()` (animatable in every engine) on circles with a static radius. The jump also now always lands on a 3 h window centred on the event instead of preserving whatever zoom the chart was at, so the marker and beacon are easy to spot rather than a speck in a day-wide axis. Verified rendering in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### `[Fix]` Dashboard updates no longer get stuck behind a year-long browser cache

The daemon served `index.html` with `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable` - a browser that loaded the dashboard once cached the entry point for a year, so it kept requesting the old hashed JS bundle and silently ran stale code after every deploy. Shipped fixes appeared to "do nothing" until a manual hard-refresh. The intended per-file override was being overridden by `@fastify/static`'s `immutable` flag; an `onSend` hook now authoritatively forces `no-cache` on every HTML document while leaving the content-hashed `/assets/*` immutable. Note: a browser that already cached the old `index.html` still needs one hard-refresh to pick up the fixed headers; after that, updates land automatically.

### `[Infra]` Deploy no longer leaves the daemon unrunnable if a build or test fails

`deploy.sh` / `deploy-systemd.sh` used to `rm -rf packages/*/dist` before building. The daemon runs from source via tsx but resolves its sibling workspace packages through their built `dist/`, so a build or test failure after that clean left every `dist/` deleted - and a `Restart=always` systemd unit then flapped the daemon forever on `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The deploy now clears only the incremental build cache (`tsbuildinfo`) and lets `tsc` overwrite `dist/` in place, so a failed deploy leaves the previously running daemon intact instead of bringing it down.

### `[Fix]` History → chart jump always lands on a visible, beaconed marker (#288)

Jumping to an event from the History drawer now force-renders that event's marker even when its kind is faded at the current zoom (price edits at week-plus ranges) or dropped by the marker cap, and highlights it with a pulsating sonar beacon - three expanding amber rings - instead of the old single ring. The beacon's countdown starts when the marker actually renders rather than at click time, so slow data loads no longer eat the highlight, and the page re-scrolls to the chart once the marker is on screen. Also fixes a bug where the highlight timer and the scroll-to-chart poller were cancelled almost immediately after the jump.

### `[Feature]` mempool.guide block-explorer preset (#289)

The Config → Block explorer presets gain mempool.guide, a mempool.space fork whose block view surfaces BIP-110 signaling.

### `[Fix]` Uptime and bid-coverage tiles count daemon-offline time as downtime (#290)

A daemon outage used to vanish from the uptime and bid-coverage percentages: the calculation weighed ticks by their duration but capped both numerator and denominator at 5 minutes per tick, so the single tick spanning an outage gap fell out of the clock entirely - a 24h window with a ~9h outage still read 99,6 % bid coverage. The denominator is now the wall-clock length of the window (clamped to the first tick ever recorded), so offline time counts as no uptime and no bid coverage. The "delivery while bidding" tile is unchanged - it deliberately isolates hardware/Datum failures from gaps, since during an outage there is no way to know whether a bid was active.

## 2026-06-11

### `[Release]` v1.14.0

Run-mode and bid-pause history (#287): History events, always-visible price-chart markers, and retroactive idle-state background bands on both charts with three new configurable color slots. History detail drawer with Reason column and bidirectional chart links (#285), sticky filters. Legend click-to-hide (#280), speed-edit markers on the hashrate chart (#281), crosshair tooltip dodging, test-locked pool-luck marker placement, and inclusive "Electrum server" labeling (#273). Migration 0111.

### `[UI]` Bid-paused marker defaults to rose (#287 follow-up)

The `bid paused` marker and its background band now default to rose `#f43f5e` instead of amber - a Braiins-side pause is bad news, so it should read as a warning. Existing color overrides are untouched.

### `[UI]` Run-mode band edges snap to the mode-change markers (#287 follow-up)

The bid-pause band's edges are the pause/resume event timestamps, so its icons sit exactly on the band edges - but the run-mode band was derived from the per-tick `run_mode` samples (1-minute resolution), so its edges landed on tick boundaries and visibly missed the power markers. The band edges now snap to the MODE_CHANGE event timestamps (the exact moment the button was pressed) whenever one exists in the bracketing tick gap, falling back to the tick midpoint for history without events. Both charts share one computation now.

### `[UI]` Inclusive "Electrum server" labeling - Fulcrum and ElectrumX work too (#273)

The payout-tracking backend was labeled "Electrs" throughout the UI, suggesting only electrs works. The daemon speaks the standard Electrum protocol, and Fulcrum has been confirmed working in the field (it's what prompted #273). Config, the setup wizard, Status tooltips, and the docs now say "Electrum server" with electrs / Fulcrum / ElectrumX named as known-good options; the Config search also finds the section via "fulcrum". Config keys (`electrs_host` / `electrs_port` / `payout_source=electrs`) are unchanged, so existing setups are unaffected.

### `[UI]` Idle-band hatching: crisper styling, edges aligned to the transition (#287 follow-up)

Operator feedback on the first build: the light tint at low opacity read as a milky frosted-glass block instead of hatching. Bands now use a darkened variant of the slot color as the base with more saturated diagonal lines - the same visual language as the existing red "Braiins unreachable" band. Band edges also moved from "first tick after the transition" to the midpoint between the bracketing ticks, so the band no longer lags the mode-change markers by a full tick. Legend chips now follow the operator's color overrides too, instead of always showing the default colors.

### `[Feature]` Idle-state background bands + configurable marker colors (#287 follow-up)

Both charts now shade the spans where the autopilot wasn't actively trading: a violet diagonal hatch while the run mode was DRY RUN or PAUSED (derived from the per-tick `run_mode` column, so the bands are retroactive over all stored history), and an amber counter-diagonal hatch while Braiins had the bid paused (from the `bid paused` → `bid resumed` event pairs). Hovering a band names the state and its duration. The three new marker colors - mode change, bid paused, bid resumed - join Config → chart colors under "Bid-event markers" with their own glyph previews; the mode-change and bid-paused colors also tint the matching bands.

### `[UI]` History → chart jump scrolls to the chart and rings top-edge markers (#285 follow-up)

"View on chart" from the History drawer now scrolls the page to the price chart when it sits below the fold, and the focus pulse anchors on the top-edge glyph for mode-change / pause / resume markers instead of ringing an empty spot on the price line.

### `[Feature]` Mode-change and pause/resume markers on the price chart (#287 follow-up)

The three new History kinds now also render as markers on the **price chart**: violet power glyph for `mode change` (one shared icon regardless of direction), amber pause and emerald play for the Braiins-side bid transitions. They use the pool-block idiom — top-edge glyph plus a full-height dashed guide line, since these events have no price anchor — and they're **always visible at every zoom level**, unlike the bid-event markers whose per-range fading exists to tame EDIT_PRICE noise; a mode change that explains a week-long gap stays visible at the 1m zoom where you'd actually notice the gap. Hover/click opens the standard pinned event tooltip; for `bid paused`, Braiins' own `last_pause_reason` rides along as the reason line. Legend chips for the three kinds appear only when at least one such marker is in view, so the legend stays uncluttered in the common case.

### `[Feature]` Run-mode switches and Braiins pause/resume in History (#287)

Three new event kinds on the History page, prompted by @regenerous in #256. (1) **`mode change`** (violet power glyph): the dashboard's DRY-RUN / LIVE / PAUSED toggle now writes a row (`LIVE → PAUSED`, source `manual`) whenever it actually changes the mode, and boot-time transitions are logged too (`boot: LIVE → DRY_RUN (boot_mode=ALWAYS_DRY_RUN)`, source `automatic`) — the classic silent gap-explainer where an overnight restart drops the controller out of LIVE. No-change boots stay quiet. (2) **`bid paused`** (amber pause glyph) and **`bid resumed`** (emerald play glyph): Braiins-side bid status transitions, observed per tick on the primary bid, with Braiins' own `last_pause_reason` in the Reason column. These complement the existing `sustained_paused` alert (which keeps its 10-minute paging threshold) with an instant, unthresholded audit row. All three kinds are filterable chips on the History toolbar and open the detail drawer like any other row. Carve-outs: mode changes never inherit a bid id from the orphan-CREATE coalesce, none of the three count toward the `mutation_count` stat, and none render as chart markers. Migration 0111 rebuilds `bid_events` to widen the kind CHECK constraint.

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck AGED OUT dots no longer drift to the bottom of the decay (marker fix v2)

Operator screenshot at build 653 showed AGED OUT dots sitting well below their steps. Build 652's "directional extremum over the window" rule was wrong for AGED OUT: the luck line decays continuously between events, so the window minimum is almost always the far END of the decay, not the step - the dot drifted right and down, disconnected from the step it belonged to. (FOUND looked correct only because a step up against decay genuinely is the local maximum.) v2 finds the step itself: the largest single-tick delta in the event's direction, with the `luckBefore → window[0]` transition as a candidate and a lower-median noise floor so uniform decay never reads as a step. Falls back to `luckBefore` at the event tick when Ocean hasn't published the post-event value yet. The dot now always sits on a value the line actually passes through at that tick. Test suite grown to 21 cases including a regression test built from the screenshot's exact shape (step then long decay).

## 2026-06-10

### `[UI]` Crosshair readout dodges pinned marker tooltips

While a pinned panel was open (e.g. a clicked BIP 110 block tooltip), the cursor-trailing crosshair readout slid underneath it - same z-index, later DOM order wins - leaving the readout unreadable until the cursor moved past. The readout now tests its candidate position against every pinned chart tooltip on screen (they all carry the `*-pinned-*` id convention) and, on overlap, tries the other three quadrants around the cursor, taking the first collision-free spot. Once the cursor is far enough from the pinned panel the default placement stops colliding and the box snaps back beside the cursor. When no pinned panel is open the positioning is byte-for-byte the previous behaviour.

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck step marker placement, locked in with a vitest

The dot on the pool-luck overlay still landed on the pre-step segment when Ocean's snapshot took more than ~15 min to publish the post-step value (operator has flagged this four-plus times across #264, #266 follow-ups, and the screenshots after that). Root cause was a 15-tick scan window that fell through to `luckBefore` when Ocean's lag exceeded it, while the directional Math.max/Math.min logic on top of that lost its grip because `luckAfter` had silently collapsed to `luckBefore`. Real fix: the dot-positioning rule is now a pure function (`packages/dashboard/src/lib/luckStepDot.ts`) that takes the events, `luckBefore`, and a window of post-event luck values, and returns the directional extremum offset+value: FOUND dot goes to the highest value the line reaches in window, AGED OUT to the lowest, mixed to first-different (legacy). Window is bounded by the next event group's `afterIdx` so adjacent events can't pollute each other, and by a generous 60-tick (~1 h) ceiling. Falls back to `luckBefore` at `afterIdx` when the window has no usable samples (honest "we know the event landed, haven't observed its effect yet" rather than a wrong placement). Hard clamp: FOUND dot is never below `luckBefore`, AGED OUT never above — so when Ocean's window-aggregate snapshot briefly moves against the per-event direction (a co-occurring AGED OUT cancelling a FOUND, etc.) the dot doesn't flip sides. Seventeen vitest cases cover Ocean updating fast, Ocean lagging beyond the legacy fence, intermediate noise, no update at all, anti-direction data, null-laced windows, mixed kinds, and edge cases (null `luckBefore`, empty window). HashrateChart.tsx now delegates to the helper instead of duplicating the rule.

### `[UI]` History → chart jump now pulses the marker; History filters sticky (#285 follow-up)

(1) When "View on chart →" pans the chart to a jumped-from event, the matching marker now pulses an expanding amber ring + a steadier glow for ~5 s so the operator can spot it immediately instead of hunting along the time axis. Pure visual cue; clicks still pass through to the marker's own hit-rect underneath. (2) History filter chips, bid-id substring, date range, and `|Δ price| ≥ N` threshold are now persisted to localStorage on every change, so a Chart-and-back round-trip preserves the operator's filter set — and the saved set carries across page reloads and sessions. Clearing all filters (or hitting Reset) wipes the storage slot so the next read returns the empty default.

### `[Feature]` History page: reason column + click-row detail drawer + bidirectional chart links (#285)

Per discussion #284, where a user looked at an unexpected CANCEL→CREATE pair in History, was confused, then resolved it themselves by zooming into the chart and hovering the marker (the bid-event tooltip carries the reason; History didn't). Three changes:

1. **`Reason` column** in History. Reads `bid_events.reason`, which `decide.ts` already populates for every autopilot-emitted event (e.g. `Datum stratum down: 3 consecutive failures — cancelling to stop spend`, `track fillable: X → Y sat/PH/day`, `create at <price> · cheap mode N PH/s`). Truncate-with-title in the cell; full text in the drawer.

2. **Click-row → slide-over drawer** with the chart-tooltip's content. Reason in full, kind-specific rows (price/speed/delta), bid id, market snapshot at the event tick (fillable, hashprice, overpay, max bid, effective cap — fetched on drawer open via a tight ±60 s `/api/metrics` window so the table-load path stays cheap), and a `copy JSON` button. Esc / X / backdrop click dismisses. Full-screen takeover on mobile, right-aligned drawer on desktop.

3. **Bidirectional chart ↔ History cross-links** without embedding a chart on /history. The drawer carries `View on chart →` (navigates to `/?focus_event=<id>&at=<ms>` — Status pans the price chart to the event's timestamp, preserves the current zoom width when reasonable, falls back to a 1 h centred window if the chart was at a > 24 h preset). The chart's pinned `BidEventTooltip` carries `Show in history →` (navigates to `/history?focus_event=<id>` — History scrolls the row into view and pulses it amber for 1.5 s). URL params are stripped after the first effect-firing via `replaceState` so navigating away and back doesn't relaunch the highlight.

Embedded chart on /history was explicitly out of scope — multi-day work, real perf cost, mobile layout problems; the cross-page links cover the same need at a fraction of the cost. Revisit only if a specific need emerges after living with the above.

### `[Fix]` BIP 110 mobile block card no longer overflows the viewport (#278 follow-up)

The previous #278 fix swapped the miner badge's fixed `max-w-[180px]` for `max-w-full`, but the card is a CSS grid item with the default `min-width: auto`, so a long miner tag (e.g. `ckpool$/Block Mined by …`) grew the card past the viewport edge - pushing the right-aligned reward / fees / txs values off-screen instead of truncating. The card now carries `min-w-0` and the grid uses an explicit shrinkable `grid-cols-1` track, so the tag truncates with an ellipsis and the card fits its column with all values visible. Verified at iPhone width: a 594px-wide overflowing card now renders at 358px.

### `[Fix]` Price chart: phantom pool-block dot + click-to-zoom no longer pins the crosshair (#282)

Two interaction fixes. (1) **Phantom pool-block dot:** at a wide zoom the Price chart could draw two blue dots a few pixels apart on the unpaid-earnings line next to a single visible block, with the extra one vanishing as you zoomed in. The pool-block markers process every block in the data extent (which includes the off-screen prefetch buffer), and a block whose own unpaid step wasn't found would inherit the previous block's step with no distance bound - so a block hours away in the buffer painted a phantom dot beside an unrelated one. The inheritance is now bounded to a 30-minute window (the genuine Ocean-batched-credit case it exists for). (2) **Click-to-focus no longer pins:** clicking a chart to focus it for wheel-zoom also pinned the synced crosshair readout, which then sat over the chart and had to be dismissed before you could pan or zoom. The focusing click no longer pins; pinning is still available on the next click once the chart is focused.

### `[Feature]` Click a legend entry to show/hide that series (#280)

Both charts were getting crowded with overlapping lines. Now every legend chip on the Hashrate and Price charts is a toggle - click "received (Datum)" or "hashprice" (etc.) to hide that series, click again to bring it back, exactly like the Bitaxe UI. Hidden chips dim and strike through. Hiding a series also rescales the Y-axis to what's left, so isolating one line lets it fill the chart instead of being squashed by a taller neighbour. The choice is saved per device (each chart independently), so a muted noisy line stays muted across reloads on that phone or desktop. Line series, reference lines (target / floor), the right-axis line, and the marker classes that carry a legend chip (pool block, found by us, edit speed, on-chain payout) are all toggleable; the grouped bid-event glyph legend is unchanged.

### `[Feature]` Speed-edit markers now appear on the hashrate chart (#281)

A speed-limit (EDIT_SPEED) change resizes the bid's PH/s cap, which directly moves the delivered-hashrate curve - but until now those events only showed on the price chart, leaving the hashrate chart unannotated for the one bid event most relevant to it. The hashrate chart now draws the same gauge glyph at the moment of each speed edit (full-height dashed line, matching its existing retarget / IP-change markers), with a hover/click tooltip showing the new speed limit and the change reason. It reuses the price chart's `events.edit_speed` color and respects the same range gating (visible through 1w, hidden at 1m+) and the global marker cap. The price chart is unchanged.

### `[Fix]` BIP 110 mobile card header no longer pushed out of band by long miner tags (#278)

On a narrow iPhone viewport, signaling-block cards whose template was built by a non-Ocean miner with a long tag (e.g. `ckpool$/Block Mined by …`) rendered the badge column out of band — the block-height number on the left and the badge column on the right stopped lining up cleanly, and the long tag dragged the row's baseline. The badge was using `inline-flex` + a fixed `max-w-[180px]`, which didn't cooperate with the parent column's width. v2 switches the badge to `flex` + `max-w-full min-w-0` so it sizes to the column, the column itself gets `min-w-0` so the `truncate` inside actually fires, and the card header moves from `items-baseline` to `items-start` so a tall or wrapping badge doesn't drag the height number's baseline. Ocean's tidy short-tag cards above are unaffected.

### `[Release]` v1.13.0

Configurable stats bar (#266), dedicated `/history` page (#256 v2), synced crosshair across both Status charts (#257), drag-to-reorder dashboard cards via per-card grip handles (#244 v2/v3), USD denomination button greys out when the oracle is unreachable instead of disappearing (#274), and a wide sweep of polish: BTC oracle inline Test button (#270 follow-up), `telegram_chat_id` redacted in `/api/debug/dump`, scan-cancel actually aborts in-flight HTTP probes (#259 v2), NerdAxe numeric `bestDiff` accepted (#260), hero price card no longer overflows on iPhone in BTC mode (#268), bid pending-cancel race fix (#276), pool-luck step marker anchors at the higher line for FOUND and the lower line for AGED OUT, BIP 110 pool/miner badge letters stay square with brand-blue Ocean, "rejection rate" renamed to "rejection ratio" everywhere. Safe to upgrade from any 1.11.x / 1.12.x release; no new migrations.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 pool/miner badge: even-width letter on long tags, blue for Ocean

The deterministic letter avatars on each BIP 110 signalling row used to squash narrower when the tag next to them was long enough to force the flex children to compete for space (`ckpool$/Block Mined by …` next to a `C` came out clearly thinner than the matching `O` two rows below). Added `shrink-0` so every letter avatar keeps its `w-5 h-5` square regardless of tag length. Ocean also gets a special-case `bg-sky-500` (its brand blue) instead of whatever the hash-of-tag picked from the generic palette, so the dominant pool in every Ocean operator's scan reads at a glance.

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck step marker anchors at the higher line for FOUND, lower for AGED OUT

The dot on the pool-luck overlay used to anchor at `luckAfter` for both event kinds, which only matched the operator's mental model ("FOUND = up, AGED = down") when the data co-operated. Because Ocean's `pool_luck` reading is a snapshot of the whole 30-day window (not just our block), other simultaneous events could mute or even invert the per-event direction — the FOUND dot would then sit at the lower line segment, confusing the read. v2 anchors a FOUND dot at `max(luckBefore, luckAfter)` and an AGED OUT dot at `min(luckBefore, luckAfter)`, so the dot's Y always matches the event's intuitive direction regardless of data noise. Mixed groups (both kinds in the same tick) keep `luckAfter` as before.

### `[Fix]` No more duplicate cancels on bids Braiins is already unwinding (#276)

Braiins accepts a bid cancellation asynchronously - the order lingers in the bids list as `PENDING_CANCEL` for up to a few minutes before disappearing. The controller treated those bids as fully alive: the Datum-down cancel sweep re-cancelled them (two cancel markers for the same order on the Price chart, observed 2026-06-06 during a gateway outage), and a dying order could even be selected as primary and receive price edits. PENDING_CANCEL bids are now excluded from every mutation path while still blocking a replacement CREATE until the old order has actually left the list, so no overlap is possible.

## 2026-06-06

### `[UI]` "rejection rate" renamed to "rejection ratio" everywhere

Braiins's own UI and docs call this metric the rejection ratio; the dashboard said "rejection rate". Renamed across the Braiins panel row, the share-rejection tile tooltip, the chart right-axis option and axis label, and the Bitaxe alert-threshold help texts, in all three languages (en / nl / es).

### `[Fix]` Price chart Y-axis scales to visible data only (#275 follow-up)

Audit follow-up to the stat-tile fix: the Price chart's left Y-axis auto-range sampled every fetched point - including the off-screen prefetch buffer extending one window-width past each viewport edge - plus the prices on off-screen bid-event markers. An off-screen price spike could stretch the visible axis with nothing on the chart explaining it. The axis now samples only points inside the visible window (the Hashrate chart and both right axes already did this). Line paths still cover the full buffer, clipped at the plot edge, so panning stays seamless.

### `[Fix]` Stat tiles now aggregate over the visible chart window, not the hidden prefetch buffer (#275)

The KPI tiles (uptime, bid coverage, delivery while bidding, avg hashrate, avg cost, P&L per-day) were computed over the chart's data-fetch window, which pads the visible viewport by one full window-width on each side for smooth panning. Zoomed into a clean-looking hour, an off-screen no-bid tick from over an hour earlier could move BID COVERAGE between 99.5% and 100.0% as you panned, with nothing visible on the chart explaining it. The tiles now use exactly the visible window the tooltips promise, and live presets (3h/24h/…) hit the server's cached per-range path.

### `[UI]` USD denomination button greys out instead of disappearing when oracle is unreachable (#274)

The denomination toggle (sats / BTC / USD) used to drop the USD option entirely whenever `btcPrice` was `null`, conflating two very different cases: oracle deliberately turned off (`btc_price_source = 'none'`) and oracle transiently unreachable (API down, DNS hiccup, rate-limited). The former is "USD isn't a feature on this install" — hide it; the latter is "USD should work, something's broken right now" — say so. The button now stays visible but renders disabled with `cursor-not-allowed` and a hover tooltip pointing the operator at Config → Pool & Payout → BTC Price Oracle / Test connection. The "deliberately disabled" case still hides the button, since the operator opted out.

### `[Fix]` Hero price card no longer overflows on mobile in BTC mode (#268)

In BTC denomination mode the current-bid price renders as e.g. `0,00046582` — about 10 characters at `text-4xl`. Inside the hero card's `grid-cols-2` layout, each column was ~150 px on iPhone, so the big number plus the absolute-positioned ± delta badge crashed into the DELIVERED column to its right. v2 stacks the PRICE / DELIVERED columns vertically on `< sm` viewports (full card width each), drops the big-number size to `text-3xl` on mobile, and moves the ± delta badge from absolute-right to inline-below the number so the centered layout stays clean. Desktop layout is unchanged.

### `[UI]` BTC oracle Test button inline + telegram_chat_id redacted in diagnostics

(1) **BTC price oracle Test button** is now inline to the right of the Price source dropdown, same `flex gap-2` row, matching the Pool URL / Datum / Telegram / bitcoind / electrs Test-connection idiom across the rest of Config. Was previously below the helper text, reading as a tacked-on extra. (2) **`telegram_chat_id` is now redacted** in `/api/debug/dump`. The chat id pairs with a stolen `bot_token` to message-spam the operator's private chat; treating it as personal-but-not-credential alongside `telegram_instance_label` and the DDNS fields.

### `[Release]` v1.12.2

Patch release: "Test connection" button for the BTC price oracle (#270) and the one-click Diagnostics support bundle with connectivity matrix + sanitized config snapshot (#272). Safe to upgrade from any 1.11.x / 1.12.x release; no new migrations.

### `[UI]` Pool-luck tiles get window-aware colour bands (#266 follow-up)

The three pool-luck tiles (24h / 7d / 30d) now colour-code the value the same way uptime / share-rejection / wallet-runway already do. Bands are window-aware because the underlying variance shrinks with window length — a 0.7× read on 24h is noisy randomness, the same read on 30d is genuinely concerning: 24h: emerald ≥ 0.90, amber 0.50–0.90, red < 0.50. 7d: emerald ≥ 0.95, amber 0.70–0.95, red < 0.70. 30d: emerald ≥ 1.00, amber 0.85–1.00, red < 0.85. Tooltips updated to mention the band-tightness choice.

### `[UI]` Uptime tooltip relates to its siblings, shorter delivery label, locale-aware best-diff (#266 follow-up x3)

(1) **Uptime tile tooltip** now spells out the relationship to its two sibling tiles instead of describing uptime in isolation: `uptime = bid coverage × delivery while bidding`, and which one explains low uptime when it happens. The operator was reading uptime ≈ delivery rate and not seeing the difference; the difference is the denominator, and the tooltip now says so. (2) **"delivery rate (while bidding)" → "delivery while bidding"** — the longer label was wrapping to three lines on a narrow tile. The word "rate" was carrying no information; the `%` unit on the caption line already makes that clear. (3) **Bitaxe best-diff value is locale-formatted** ("149,53" in `nl-NL`, not `149.53`) and the magnitude prefix moves to the grey unit-caption line as its full SI name (`giga`, `tera`, `peta`, etc.) instead of the squashed single-letter form jammed into the number. Same idiom as every other tile.

### `[UI]` Rearrange button is back; handles only show in edit mode (#244 v3)

The always-on gutter from build 631 ate ~26 px off every card's width — fine on desktop, cramped on mobile, paid for a feature the operator uses three times in a dashboard's lifetime. v3 reverts to a gated approach: the **Rearrange** button is back in the header (and the hamburger), cards render plain by default, and only when the operator clicks Rearrange does the gutter + grip handles appear. The grips themselves are now amber with a subtle glow so they read as a clear handle while editing, not dust in the corner. Drag listeners stay bound to the grip button only, so chart pan/zoom and panel buttons keep working even mid-edit — that part stays better than v1's pointer-events-none.

### `[UI]` Drag-handle gutter for dashboard cards (#244 v2 follow-up)

The hover-to-reveal handle from the previous commit floated awkwardly above each card's title row. Build 631 moves it into a slim 20 px left gutter next to every card so the handle sits *beside* the title rather than on top of it. Always faintly visible (slate-700), brightens to amber with a subtle glow on hover, full opacity during a drag — the discoverability the operator asked for. The title text inside each card flows normally; no per-card markup changes needed.

### `[Feature]` Drag any dashboard card to reorder (#244 v2)

The "Rearrange" mode toggle in the header is gone. Hover any card on the Status page and a small grip handle fades in at its top-left; drag from there to slide it up or down (touch users get a 180 ms press-and-hold; on mobile-without-hover the grip is permanently faintly visible). The 6 px PointerSensor distance gate keeps a click near the grip from being treated as a drag, and charts keep their pan-and-zoom because drag listeners are bound to the grip button only, not the card body. Same pattern that's already on the TilesBar — now applied to every top-level card. The escape hatch is a tiny `reset layout` link that appears in the header on the Status page only when the saved order differs from the default.
### `[Feature]` Diagnostics support bundle: one-click connectivity matrix + sanitized config (#272)

New Config → Display & Logging → Diagnostics panel. "Run diagnostics" probes every external service the daemon talks to in parallel - Braiins API, Ocean API, Datum gateway, bitcoind RPC, electrs, Telegram, all four BTC price providers, public-IP service, plus a DNS-sanity check - each reporting latency or the concrete error (HTTP status, `ENOTFOUND`, timeout). "Copy as Markdown" produces a paste-ready block for bug reports: identity (version/build/node/uptime/run mode), the connectivity table, last-tick freshness per integration, and the full configuration with every sensitive field rendered as a loud `********** [redacted]` marker so it's visibly safe to paste - credentials, payout address, pool/DDNS hostnames and the public IP are all stripped (LAN addresses stay, they're what support needs); a separate Copy JSON button copies just the config snapshot. The bug-report template now asks for it. Born out of #267, where diagnosing a failing price oracle took days of back-and-forth curls.

### `[Feature]` "Test connection" button for the BTC price oracle (#270)

One click in Config → Pool & Payout → BTC price oracle now performs a live fetch against the selected provider (saved or not) and reports the result inline: the current BTC/USD price on success, or the concrete failure on error - the HTTP status (e.g. `429` rate-limited) or the underlying network error code (`ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNREFUSED`), instead of the USD toggle just silently not appearing (#267). A successful test warms the daemon's price cache so the header's USD toggle lights up immediately. Price fetches now also send an explicit User-Agent (bot-sensitive CDN endpoints reject anonymous requests) and daemon logs include the real network error instead of a bare "fetch failed".

### `[Release]` v1.12.1

Hotfix release carrying only the NerdAxe fix (#260): NerdAxe / NerdQAxe miners now appear on the Status page, numeric best-difficulty values are handled natively, one misbehaving device can no longer freeze the whole miners card, and unreachable-device errors include the underlying network error code. Safe to upgrade from any 1.11.x / 1.12.x release; no new migrations.

### `[Fix]` Scan-local-network cancel actually stops the scan (#259 v2)

Closing the scan dialog with `X` while a sweep was in flight didn't actually stop the scan, despite build 605's "cancel" handling. Two bugs compounded: (1) **daemon side**, cancel only set a `cancelRequested` flag the workers checked between probes — so each of the 8 workers ran out its current 1.5 s probe timeout before bailing, and to a watching operator the scan looked like it kept hitting hosts. (2) **dashboard side**, the status query was gated on the dialog being open, so the moment the operator closed it polling stopped — the trigger button then stayed stuck on `scanning…` indefinitely because the dashboard never observed the state transition to `cancelled`. v2 plumbs an `AbortController` signal into the per-probe fetch so cancel aborts every in-flight request immediately (cancel-to-`cancelled` latency drops from ~1.5 s to a few ms), and the dashboard keeps polling whenever the last known state was `running` regardless of dialog visibility, so the trigger button reverts to `Scan local network` on its own.

### `[Feature]` Drag tiles left/right to reorder (#266 follow-up)

Each tile in the stats bar now carries a grip handle in the top-left corner that's invisible by default and fades in on hover. Drag from the grip to slide the tile left/right; siblings shift to make room. No global rearrange-mode gate — the operator doesn't have to toggle anything to start reordering. Touch-friendly press-and-hold (180 ms) so vertical page scrolling on mobile isn't hijacked, and a 6 px distance gate on desktop so a click in the grip's vicinity doesn't accidentally start a drag. Order persists through `config.dashboard_tiles` the same way the picker does.

### `[UI]` Self-contained pool-luck tooltips, bigger chevron hit-box (#266 follow-up x2)

(1) **Pool luck 7d / 30d tooltips now stand on their own** — operator may only have one of the three pool-luck tiles on screen, so each tooltip carries the full formula and ">1 lucky / <1 unlucky" reading. No more "same formula as 24 h" cross-reference. (2) **Tile-chevron click target widened** from the 14×14 SVG to ~28×28 via padding; the visible icon is unchanged so the tile looks the same but the chevron is much easier to hit.

## 2026-06-05

### `[Feature]` Bitaxe best-diff tile + share-rejection consistency + pool-luck caption (#266 follow-up x3)

(1) **New `Bitaxe best diff` tile.** Highest `best_diff` across reachable Bitaxe miners; matches the "best diff" row in the Bitaxe miners card below. (2) **Share-rejection tile now reads from the same source as the Braiins panel's "rejection rate" row** (`finance.braiins_rejection_pct`, first-last cumulative counter diff over the chart range). The old tile path computed a per-tick-delta SUM in `/api/stats` which diverged across bid rotations — the cumulative-diff method skips the reset point cleanly. The unused `/api/stats` field is gone. (3) **Pool-luck multiplier moved to the caption line.** Renders as `0,54` big with `× expected` small/grey below, matching the rest of the tile catalogue's "big number + grey unit" idiom.

### `[UI]` Bitaxe tiles always in TH (#266 follow-up x2)

(1) **Bitaxe hashrate tile always renders in TH/s**, ignoring the page-wide TH/PH/EH toggle. The toggle is right for big-network-scale figures (marketplace bid, Braiins delivered) but a typical Bitaxe is ~1 TH/s, so the global PH default rounded the fleet total to `0,00`. The tooltip now explains the deliberate unit choice. (2) **Bitaxe efficiency `J/TH` moved to the unit-caption line** (small grey below the number) to match the rest of the tile catalogue's "big number + grey unit" idiom — was previously rendering as `17,3 J/TH` all in the big-number style, breaking onto two lines.

### `[Fix]` NerdAxe miners never appeared on the Status page (#260)

NerdAxe / NerdQAxe firmware (shufps/ESP-Miner-NerdQAxePlus family) reports `bestDiff` / `bestSessionDiff` as raw numbers where stock Bitaxe firmware reports magnitude-suffixed strings ("4.29G"). The daemon's difficulty parser crashed on the numeric form, killing the poll tick *after* a successful fetch but *before* the snapshot update - so every successful poll was silently discarded while failed polls rendered, freezing the Bitaxe Miners card on the last failure (or showing nothing at all). Numeric difficulty values are now accepted natively (same unit - share difficulty - just unformatted), formatted for display the way AxeOS itself does, and stored at full precision for best-difficulty records. One device's malformed payload can no longer take down the whole fleet's poll, and unreachable-device errors now include the underlying network error code instead of a bare "fetch failed".

### `[Fix]` Stats tiles empty + chart-marker tooltip overflow (#266 follow-up x2)

(1) **`/api/stats` was returning 500**, breaking every stats-derived tile (uptime, delivery rate, avg Braiins / Datum / Ocean, etc.) — fields rendered as em-dash. Build 622 added `avg_share_rejection_pct` referencing `primary_bid_shares_purchased_m` / `_rejected_m` in the outer aggregate, but didn't carry those columns through the inner subquery's SELECT list. The whole query errored out; Fastify returned the error to the dashboard which silently fell back to "no data". Bitaxe tiles (different data source) were unaffected. (2) **Chart-marker tooltips no longer overflow into the neighbouring chart.** New `sideTooltipPosition` helper opens marker tooltips to the LEFT of the marker (RIGHT if no room left), vertically centred on the marker. Pool-block / retarget / luck-step / bid-event / deposit / payout-initiated tooltips now stay beside the data point instead of extending downward into the next chart's territory.

### `[UI]` Tile-picker click fix, custom locale date picker, edit-speed prices, mobile nav (#266 follow-up x4)

(1) **Tile picker options were unclickable** after build 622. The dropdown is portal-rendered to `document.body`; the parent's outside-click handler was attached on the tile's container ref, which does not contain the portaled dropdown. Result: `mousedown` on an option triggered "outside" → `setOpen(false)` → picker unmounts before the option's `onClick` (a `click` event) can land. Moved the outside-click detection into the portal component, where it can check both the dropdown contents AND the anchor. (2) **Custom date picker** for the History page From / To inputs. Browser-native `<input type=date>` renders in the browser's locale, not the dashboard's chosen language, so an NL operator using English UI saw `mm/dd/yyyy` placeholders. The new `DatePicker` formats via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in the active locale (Mon/Tue weekday headers in Dutch, EU week starting on Monday, etc.), opens a portal popover with month navigation, includes Today/Clear shortcuts. (3) **Price columns on EDIT_SPEED rows** now show the bid's effective last-known price in both before and after, with delta = zero. New SQL CTE `effective_last_price_sat` pulls the most recent CREATE_BID/EDIT_PRICE `new_price_sat` for the same effective_order_id at-or-before the row. (4) **Mobile nav** no longer wraps to two rows: nav links (Status / Alerts / History / Config) fold into the hamburger on viewports below `sm`, keeping the top bar single-row on iPhone. Alert badge moves with them.

### `[UI]` Tiles + history sweep (#266 follow-up x5, #256 follow-up)

Tiles bar: (1) the question-mark icon next to each tile label is gone — operator caught it as visual noise. Tooltip now wraps the whole tile so hovering anywhere on the panel surfaces the explanation. (2) "ADD TILE" → "add tile" lowercase to match the `right axis` idiom on the other rows. (3) The picker dropdown is now a portal at `document.body` with intrinsic-width sizing (min 14rem / max 22rem) — was sometimes squashed to a single-character-wide column when the trigger sat near the right edge. Both per-tile pickers AND the "+ add tile" picker go through the same viewport-clamped positioning logic. (4) All catalogue tiles are now fully wired: `share_rejection_pct` reads a new window-averaged `avg_share_rejection_pct` on `StatsResponse`; `bitaxe_fleet_hashrate` / `bitaxe_fleet_power` / `bitaxe_fleet_efficiency_j_per_th` sum across reachable Bitaxe miners from the solo-miners snapshot. No more "data source pending" placeholders.

History page: (1) SQL `effective_braiins_order_id` coalesce uses a CTE so the speed lookup can join on the COALESCED id, not the direct (often null) `e.braiins_order_id`. Build 621's join failed for the most common case — an EDIT_PRICE row on bid X looking for the CREATE's speed, when the CREATE's row had `braiins_order_id = null`. Window also widened from 5 min to 1 h. (2) Source filter and Source column removed; the OPERATOR vs AUTOPILOT distinction has no UI path to OPERATOR yet, so the filter / column were always "AUTO". (3) Column header `uppercase` removed — heads now render in Title Case as written. (4) Δ price label cleaned up: no surrounding `|...|`, no all-caps applied via CSS.

### `[UI]` History page polish: action chips with glyphs, full bid id, denomination-aware Δ filter, date picker no longer drops a day, more (#256 v2 follow-up)

A sweep of fixes against build 618 the operator caught: (1) Action filter chips (create / price / speed / cancel) now carry the same Lucide glyphs as the table rows, so the toolbar is a visual map of what the table will show. (2) Bid id renders in full (`B86640538376704234`), not truncated. (3) The CREATE_BID row used to show an em-dash in the Bid column because the daemon emits CREATE before Braiins echoes back the assigned ID; SQL now coalesces from the next event on the same logical bid (within 5 min) so the column is never empty for an identifiable bid. (4) Same idea for Speed: most non-CREATE / non-EDIT_SPEED rows carried `speed_limit_ph = null` because no operator action changed the speed at that moment; SQL now surfaces the most recent CREATE_BID or EDIT_SPEED's speed_limit_ph on the same bid, so the column always shows the bid's actual configured speed. (5) Fillable column moved next to Price before / Price after / Δ price so the price-related columns sit together. (6) The `|Δ price| ≥ N` filter now respects the page's hashrate denomination toggle — when on TH, the input is in sat/TH/day; when on EH, in sat/EH/day. Internal conversion to the daemon's sat/PH/day on the wire. (7) Spinner buttons on the numeric input were misaligned; hidden in favour of plain typing. (8) Date picker dropped a day every time (clicking 2 Jun set 1 Jun in UTC-3) because `new Date('2026-06-02')` parses as UTC midnight; now parses the YYYY-MM-DD string as LOCAL midnight. (9) Source dropdown gets a question-mark icon with a styled `<Tooltip>` explaining "AUTOPILOT = controller-emitted, MANUAL = operator override". (10) "Clear all" renamed to "Reset", moved to the right side of the toolbar, with a Lucide `rotate-ccw` icon.

### `[UI]` Tiles bar polish: time selectors moved, picker anchored at chevron, styled tooltips (#266 follow-up x4)

(1) The `+ add tile` affordance lived directly under the period block's time-range buttons (3h/6h/…/All) on the right and overlapped them on narrow viewports — couldn't be clicked. Moved the time-range buttons to the LEFT side of the period row so the right side of both rows is clear for the tile UI. (2) Re-styled the `+ add tile` as an inline label + select-style button (`add tile [pick… ▾]`) to match the `right axis [▾]` idiom used elsewhere on the page. (3) Tile tooltips now use the styled `<Tooltip>` component (portal-positioned, viewport-aware, matches the rest of the dashboard) instead of the browser's default `title=` chrome; a small question-mark icon next to each label signals hoverable detail. (4) The tile-picker dropdown was anchored to the tile's left edge and could overflow the viewport when the tile sat near the right. Now positions itself relative to the chevron the operator clicked, opens with right-edge alignment so it grows leftward into the page, and clamps to the viewport on both axes (flips above if no room below). Custom-styled scrollbar inside the dropdown so it doesn't look like a 17 px-wide raw browser track.

### `[Fix]` Crosshair tooltip clamps to its own chart (#257 follow-up)

The crosshair tooltip's flip / shift logic used `window.innerWidth` / `window.innerHeight` as the fence. On the Hashrate chart that meant a bottom-anchored tooltip could overflow into the Price chart's area below, and vice versa. Now clamps to the SVG's own bounding rect so each chart's tooltip stays within its own chart's box. Last-resort clamp pushes the tooltip up against the chart edge if it's taller than the chart so spill never reaches the neighbouring chart.

### `[Fix]` Bitaxe scan dialog X actually cancels the scan (#259 follow-up)

Build 612's fix made the button clickable again but the server-side sweep kept running. Now closing the dialog with the X calls a new `POST /api/solo-miners/scan/cancel` endpoint; the scanner's worker loop checks a `cancelRequested` flag at every iteration and bails within one probe-timeout (~1.5 s). The status transitions to a new `cancelled` state so the dashboard can distinguish "operator dismissed" from "finished naturally". A subsequent click on "Scan local network" resets the flag and starts a fresh sweep, as expected.

### `[Feature]` History page rewritten as a flat filterable table (#256 v2)

Operator feedback on build 617: "when did the last edit_speed happen?" is a flat-table-with-filters question, not a per-bid grouping question. Retired the collapsible-by-bid view from build 615 entirely.

New layout: toolbar of filters at the top + flat table + infinite scroll. Columns are `When | Bid | Action | Price before | Price after | Δ price | Fillable | Speed | Source`. Bid id stays a column (truncated `B866…04234`, hover for full) rather than the row group. Δ price colour-coded — green = price went down, red = up. Reason column dropped (the action + numeric columns carry the meaningful info; the free-text Reason mostly repeated the numbers).

Toolbar filters: action kind (toggle chips for create/price/speed/cancel), bid id text contains, date range (from/to), source (autopilot/manual), `|Δ price| ≥ N sat/PH/day`. All filters apply server-side so they work over the full dataset, not just the loaded page. "Clear all" link at the end.

Server: new `GET /api/bid-history-events` endpoint with cursor pagination (100 events per page), all filters supported. Each row also includes `fillable_at_event_sat_per_ph_day` — the dashboard joins-via-subquery to find the most recent tick at-or-before each event with a non-null fillable reading. Auto-loads the next page via IntersectionObserver when the sentinel near the bottom enters view; a "Load more" button is the manual fallback.

Note: the design interview picked "three fillable columns (before / after / Δ)". v2 ships a single `Fillable` column showing the value at the event time; computing meaningful before / after / Δ values per row across pagination boundaries needs more work and ships in a v3 follow-up.

nl + es translations included.

### `[UI]` Tiles + history disclosure: a sweep of small fixes (#266 follow-up x3, #256 polish)

Tiles bar (#266 follow-up x3): (1) `auto-rows-fr` so every tile matches the row's tallest — pool-luck (no unit caption) and uptime (with caption) line up at the same baseline. Caption slot is always reserved (non-breaking space when no unit) so two tiles next to each other don't end up at different heights. (2) Chevron moved out of the label row into a proper 14×14 Lucide `chevron-down` glyph in the top-right corner of each tile. The label now allowed to wrap to two lines instead of being clipped (so "AVG COST VS HASHPRICE" doesn't become "AVG COST VS HA…"). (3) The "+ add" tile no longer sits in the grid eating a panel width — moved to a small icon button anchored above the section's top-right corner. (4) Picking a tile that's already in another slot used to silently duplicate it, making the source slot look like it had disappeared. Now disabled in the picker with "(already in use)" hint — operator removes the other slot first if they want to move it. (5) Wallet runway reads "17 days" instead of "17 d".

History page (#256 polish): the disclosure triangle (`▸` / `▾`) on each bid header was rendering as a tiny dot at the page's text size; replaced with a 16×16 Lucide chevron glyph. Same treatment applied to the Alerts page disclosure triangle (operator caught both at once).

### `[Feature]` Chart crosshair: hover or place a marker to read every series at a point (#257)

NerdAxe-style crosshair on the Status charts. Hovering either chart draws a vertical marker line through both (they share a time axis) and shows a per-chart floating readout of every visible series at the snapped tick — delivered/Datum/Ocean/target/floor on the Hashrate chart, bid/fillable/hashprice/max-bid on the Price chart, plus whichever right-axis series is selected, all in the global sats/BTC/USD and TH/PH/EH units. Click pins the marker so it survives moving away (Esc or a click outside dismisses); on touch, press-and-hold ~300 ms then scrub to move the marker, lift to pin — a quick drag still pans as before. Hovering a block/retarget/IP marker icon shows its rich tooltip instead, as today.

### `[Feature]` Standalone /history page with bid-grouped event log (#256 follow-up)

Replaces the bottom-of-Status `OrderHistoryCard` from build 612 with a dedicated `/history` route (new "History" tab between Alerts and Config). Each bid renders as a collapsible parent row with summary stats (created → last event, first price → last price, event count, status badge); click to expand the bid and load every event for that order, oldest first. Modification table columns are `When | Action | Delta | Reason` (matches what Braiins's own Buy Order History tab shows). Bid headers paginate with a "Load older bids" button at the bottom — no more 200-row cap. Server-side: new `GET /api/bid-history?limit=N&before_ms=cursor` for the paginated bid summaries, `GET /api/bid-history/:order_id/events` for one bid's full event list. nl + es translations included.

### `[Fix]` Tiles bar auto-flows past 6 columns + add-tile affordance no longer eats a row (#266 follow-up x2)

Build 614's `lg:grid-cols-6` cap meant a wide 4K screen could only show 6 tiles per row even with room for 10+. Switched to `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr))` so the grid stretches to the natural maximum at each viewport size. Same pass: the always-visible dashed "+ add" tile from build 614 consumed a full extra row whenever the tile count wasn't a multiple of the column count. Replaced with a slim ghost-tile-sized `+` button that sits at the row's end, still discoverable but doesn't eat vertical space.

### `[Fix]` Configurable tiles: picker now works in rearrange mode + visual styling matches the old StatCard (#266 follow-up)

Two regressions caught immediately on first try: (1) the picker chevron and `+ add` button didn't respond to clicks while the page was in rearrange mode — SortableDashboard wraps block content in `pointer-events-none` while rearranging (intentional per #244 so a stray tap can't fire a button mid-drag), but that also killed the picker since the picker *is* the tile customisation flow. Picker controls now carry `pointer-events-auto` so they're exempt from the block-level inert wrapper while the rest of the content stays inert. (2) The tile rendering didn't match the original StatCard idiom — the value and unit ran together in the same big font. Now matches: centered value (big mono), slim grey unit caption below, sat symbol where appropriate. The whole tile header strip is clickable now (not just the tiny chevron triangle).

Behavioural change: the picker is no longer gated behind rearrange mode at all (per the original design-interview pick "same flow whether in rearrange mode or not"). Click the tile's header anywhere to open the dropdown; pick a different tile to swap, or use "Remove this tile" at the bottom of the dropdown to drop the slot. `+ add` at the row end always shows when count < max.

### `[Feature]` Configurable StatsBar tiles (#266)

The horizontal six-tile bar at the top of Status is now operator-customisable. Each tile slot has a chevron dropdown (visible in rearrange mode) over a curated catalogue of ~22 entries: the existing 6, the uptime decomposition tiles from #254, hashrate target (#255), avg overpay intent/settled, hashprice now, pool blocks 30d, pool luck 24h/7d/30d, share log %, share rejection, wallet runway, and Bitaxe fleet hashrate / power / J-per-TH. Variable slot count — add up to 24 tiles, remove via the × in rearrange mode, swap by picking a different entry. Choice persists to `config.dashboard_tiles` (daemon-side), so the layout follows the operator across browsers and devices. Defaults to today's six tiles when the field is empty, so existing installs see no change. nl + es translations included. A few tiles (share rejection, Bitaxe fleet) render an em-dash for now and call out "follow-up" in the tooltip — the underlying data sources need additional dashboard plumbing that will land in a separate commit.

### `[Fix]` Price chart bottom x-axis line no longer overlaps the right-axis labels (#262)

The grey x-axis line at the bottom of the Price chart drew from `PADDING.left` to `WIDTH - PADDING.right` even when a right-axis was rendered. The right-axis labels live further left, in `padRight` instead of `PADDING.right`, so the x-axis line extended into the labels. The Hashrate chart already used `padRight`; the Price chart had drifted. One-character fix on the `x2` attribute.

### `[Fix]` Bitaxe scan button no longer stays stuck on "scanning…" after the scan dialog is dismissed (#259)

Closing the local-network scan popup with the X left the underlying scan running server-side. The scan button stayed disabled and showing "scanning…" until the scan finished naturally, with no way to re-open the dialog or cancel. Now the button stays clickable while the scan is in progress; clicking it during a scan re-opens the dialog showing live progress instead of trying to start a new scan that the server would reject anyway.

### `[Feature]` Hashrate target line on the chart now steps when cheap-mode engages or disengages (#255)

`tick_metrics.target_ph` was persisting the *configured* `target_hashrate_ph` regardless of cheap-mode state, so the dashed "target" line on the Hashrate chart stayed flat even when the controller had dropped to `cheap_target_hashrate_ph`. Now persists the *effective* target (post-cheap-mode), so the dashed line steps the moment cheap-mode engages and steps back when it disengages — gives the operator visibility into when the autopilot is being thrifty.

### `[Feature]` Uptime tile decomposes into bid-coverage × delivery-when-bidding (#254)

The UPTIME tile previously showed a single percentage that conflated "orderbook didn't cooperate" with "hardware/connection failed". Tooltip now breaks down the figure as two components: bid coverage (% of window with an active Braiins bid — orderbook availability) and delivery rate while bidding (% of that bid-active time that actually delivered hashrate — hardware/connection/Datum-side quality). The two multiply to the overall uptime number. New fields `uptime_bid_coverage_pct` and `uptime_delivery_when_bid_active_pct` on the stats API; tile catalogue (#266) will surface them as discrete tiles when that lands.

### `[Feature]` Order history card on the Status page (#256)

New card mirroring Braiins's History tab on the Buy Order window. Shows every controller action (CREATE / EDIT_PRICE / EDIT_SPEED / CANCEL) for the selected chart range as a scrollable table: timestamp, action with the same Lucide glyph as the chart marker, price change with delta, Braiins order ID, and the controller's reason. Newest first, capped at 200 rows per range. Operator no longer has to round-trip to braiins.com to see what the autopilot has been doing. Block ID `order_history`, sits between Profit & Loss and Last tick proposals in the default order; reorderable via the existing #244 drag-to-rearrange flow.

### `[UI]` Bid-event glyphs swapped for domain-meaningful Lucide icons (#265 follow-up x3)

CREATE_BID now uses Lucide `circle-plus` (filled-feel new-bid mark), EDIT_SPEED uses `gauge` (literal speedometer for what's actually changing), CANCEL_BID uses `ban` (universal "no" symbol). Replaces the bare `plus` / `diamond` / `x` shapes from build 610 — same Lucide library, but icons that carry the meaning of the event rather than just acting as geometric markers. EDIT_PRICE stays as the bare yellow circle because the band-of-dots pattern *is* the meaning, no icon helps. Chart legend at the top and Config → Chart colors row-previews updated in lockstep so the operator's lookup ("see + in legend → find + on chart") keeps holding.

### `[UI]` Rare bid-event glyphs match the pool-block cube size and position + visible on zoom-out (#265 follow-up x2)

Two regressions from the build 608 redesign that the operator caught against side-by-side cubes: (1) the +/◆/× glyphs at the chart top were 8×8 SVG units while the pool-block cubes next to them were 14×14, making the rare-event markers look ~75 % smaller; (2) the glyphs sat at `y = PADDING.top - 1` while the cubes sit at `y = PADDING.top - 11`, so the bid-event markers were 3 px lower than the blocks they were supposed to align with. Re-rendered as inline `<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">` with Lucide-style paths (plus, x, diamond) at the same 14×14 footprint and same y as the cubes — visual parity at any zoom.

Same release: server-side `/api/bid-events` used the fetch span (visible × 3) for the kind filter, while the client expected kinds based on visible span. At 60 h visible the fetch span is 180 h, past the 7-day cutoff in `showEventKindsForSpan`, so the server returned empty even though the client expected to render CREATE / EDIT_SPEED / CANCEL glyphs. Symptom: at any zoom past ~56 h visible the rare markers vanished entirely. Added a `span=<ms>` query parameter so the filter sees the visible span; client passes it; legacy callers (no `span`) keep the old behaviour.

### `[Infra]` Debug-dump endpoint now covers every diagnosable subsystem

`/api/debug/dump` previously bundled tick_metrics, pool_blocks, alert_events, bid_events, reward_events, app_config, and daemon_info. Added every other table that's actually load-bearing when triaging a bug report: `solo_miners` + the live `solo_miner_snapshot` (what the Status page actually renders), `solo_miner_samples`, `solo_best_diff_events`, `owned_bids` (current Braiins-side bid roster), `braiins_deposits` (settle history), `decisions` (controller per-tick proposals), `ip_change_events`, and `runtime_state`. Time-series tables (samples, decisions, events) honour the existing `hours` window; lookup state (solo_miners, owned_bids, snapshot, runtime_state, deposits) always returns the full current snapshot. Same `debug_api_enabled` gate, same `tables=` filter behaviour. The motivation: solo-mining bug reports (e.g. #260) previously needed an extra round-trip to `/api/solo-miners` because the dump didn't include the device list or snapshot.

### `[UI]` Rare bid-event markers move to the top of the price chart (#265 follow-up)

Build 607's "thin dashed guide line from chart top" wasn't bold enough — operator still had to zoom to 400 % to spot the green +. Redesigned the rare markers to match the pool-block idiom that already works on this chart: the CREATE / EDIT_SPEED / CANCEL glyph sits at the chart's top edge (next to where the pool-block cubes live), a dashed vertical connector runs down through the chart, and a small filled bubble lands on the our_bid line at the event's price level. The top glyph gives you something to scan along the top of the chart for; the bubble gives you the price coordinate; the connector ties them together. EDIT_PRICE still sits as a plain yellow circle on the line — individual edits are read as a band, and a top glyph per edit would clutter the chart beyond use.

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck step dots back on the post-step segment (#264)

The pool-luck step-marker rewrite in build 605 anchored the dot's y-position at `points[afterIdx][luckKey]` — the persisted luck reading at the first daemon tick at-or-after the block's on-chain timestamp. Ocean's `/v1/statsnap` refresher only re-polls every ~5 min, so the value at that tick is often still the pre-event baseline, leaving the dot drawn on the lower (pre-step) horizontal segment of the line while the visible step lands a tick or two later. Mirrored PriceChart's already-working scan-forward pattern: after the timestamp-based grouping, scan up to 15 ticks forward for the first tick where the luck value actually steps off the pre-event baseline and anchor the dot's `cx`/`cy` there. Attribution by `afterIdx` (which keeps multi-event in/out cancellations correct) is unchanged.

### `[Release]` v1.12.0

Public-IP change tracking + chart markers (#250), drag-to-reorder Status page cards (#244), configurable marker colors with live SVG previews, return-on-spend P&L row (#249), Braiins share-rejection rate as chart series + card row (#243), pool-luck step-marker algorithm rewritten (timestamp-anchored + multi-event collapse), continuous chart-bucket scaling (no more 30× cliff at 24 h), "Solo miners" renamed to "Bitaxe miners" everywhere user-facing, migration runner self-heals half-applied schema state, public-IP poll dropped from 5 min to 60 s. New migrations 0106-0109. Safe to upgrade from any 1.11.x release. Refreshed `dashboard.png`, `config-display-and-logging.png`, `config-pool-and-payout.png`, `config-notifications.png` (the last two switched from `.jpg` to `.png` — README references updated). README gained a Tip jar section.

### `[UI]` Replaced the last ASCII `->` arrow in a tooltip with the Unicode `→` (U+2192)

Sweep of every user-facing display string in the dashboard found one stray `->`: the AVG OCEAN tooltip's "Braiins -> Datum -> Ocean pipeline" wording. Updated to "Braiins → Datum → Ocean". Translations refreshed for en + nl + es. JSDoc comments, log statements, and the bid-summary parser regex (which intentionally accepts both forms because daemon-emitted strings can use either) were left as-is.

### `[UI]` 'Solo miners' renamed to 'Bitaxe miners' + chart-colors preview icons now byte-identical to the chart's

The "Solo miners" naming overstated what the integration actually supports — only Bitaxe / AxeOS firmware, not solo mining in general (a Bitaxe can pool-mine too). Renamed across the dashboard card, Config tab and section heading, alert labels (overheating / offline / share-rejection / stratum drift / best-difficulty record), right-axis chart series ("Bitaxe hashrate" / "Bitaxe device count" / "Bitaxe max temp" / "Bitaxe best difficulty" / "Bitaxe power (W)"), and the empty-state copy. Internal code identifiers (`solo_*` field names, repo names) stay unchanged. Translations cover en + nl + es.

Same pass: the chart-colors row previews for pool block, on-chain payout (gem), and Braiins deposit were drawn with approximated SVG paths in build 602 that didn't match what the chart actually renders. Replaced with the exact Lucide paths copied verbatim from `HashrateChart.tsx` (pool block cube) and `PriceChart.tsx` (gem + refuelling/fuel-pump icons), so the preview next to each row is byte-identical to what appears on the chart. Also fixed a wiring mistake: `price.marker_payout_gem` was inadvertently routed to the pool-block circles on the price chart while the actual on-chain-payout gem still used a module-level hardcoded colour. Now the override flows to the correct marker, and the pool-block circles share the `hashrate.pool_block_others` key with the hashrate chart's cubes.

### `[UI]` Chart colors section reshuffled to follow chart layout, each row shows its actual marker icon

The first reshuffle in build 601 grouped by element kind (Lines / Markers / Bid events), which lost the at-a-glance chart-by-chart structure. Reverted to three chart-shaped groups: **Hashrate chart** (its line series), **Price chart** (its line series + a "Bid-event markers" subgroup, because the bid markers only render on the price chart), and **Markers** (block + icon markers shared across both charts). Each row also now renders a small live preview of its actual glyph next to the label — a cube for the pool block row, a crown for the own-pool-block row, a pickaxe for retarget, a router for IP change, gems for the on-chain-payout and Braiins-deposit rows, and the per-kind glyph (+ / ● / ◆ / ×) for the bid events. The preview updates instantly as you pick new colours so the row labelled "own pool block" actually shows the crown rather than the parenthetical "(crown)" hint it had in build 601.

### `[Feature]` Marker colors now configurable + Chart colors section reorganised into Lines / Markers / Bid events

The Config → Chart colors section grew five new keys for marker icons that previously used hardcoded hex values: BIP 110-signalling block (yellow cube), difficulty retarget (purple pickaxe), public-IP change (sky router), on-chain payout (emerald gem), and Braiins deposit (purple gem). All of them now go through the same `chart_color_overrides` JSON-bag mechanism the existing line colors used, so the picker UI, hex-validation, and "reset to defaults" all work identically. The section itself is reorganised into three groups - **Lines** (left + right axis series across both charts), **Markers** (block + icon markers), and **Bid events** (the per-tick create/edit/cancel glyphs) - so it's easier to find a specific colour without scanning the whole list.

One key rename for cleanliness: `price.unpaid` (which never actually drove the unpaid sat line — it only ever coloured the deposit gem) is now `price.marker_deposit`. Any saved overrides under the old key are transparently migrated by the parser, so nobody has to re-pick their colour. Translations cover en + nl + es.

### `[UI]` Green `FOUND` / red `AGED OUT` badge now appears on every pool-luck tooltip

The badge was added in build 597 only when two events combined in one tick. Operator preference is to keep it visible on every pool-luck event panel - the traffic-light cue (green = block landed, red = block aged out) is a faster visual read than the +/- in the header. The badge stays in the same fixed-width centered slot so block heights line up cleanly under it regardless of whether the panel is part of a single- or multi-event tooltip.

### `[UI]` Multi-event pool-luck tooltip: badges have fixed width and every block has its own explorer link

Two refinements to the combined tooltip from build 597. The `found` / `aged out` badges have different intrinsic widths, so block heights following them didn't align vertically across the per-event panels. The badges now sit in a fixed-width centered slot, so heights line up cleanly down the tooltip. Also, each event panel now carries its own "open in explorer →" link instead of only the last panel — when two blocks contribute to the same step, both should be inspectable directly.

### `[Docs]` Rejection-rate tooltip cites both Braiins's inherent rate and realistic end-to-end values

Build 594 introduced a tooltip on the Braiins rejection-rate row that called 0.05 % the "healthy baseline." That number is correct as Braiins's own published inherent marketplace-routing rate (per their academy / trading FAQ, recorded in `docs/research.md`), but it's only achievable when nothing miner-side is wrong — most end-to-end home setups land between 0.05 % and 0.5 % even when everything is healthy, and ChatGPT-style sources reasonably cite that wider range. Rewrote the tooltip to surface both anchors: 0.05 % as Braiins's inherent rate (best case), 0.05-0.5 % as the practical healthy range you'd typically see, and >1 % as the threshold for investigation. Added a sentence noting rejected shares are still paid for under Braiins's terms (the buyer is responsible for target-pool quality), which is the load-bearing reason to keep the rate visible at all. Translations updated en + nl + es.

### `[UI]` Pool-luck dots group multi-event ticks into a single marker with a combined tooltip

Build 595 fixed dots binding to the wrong block when two events landed in the same daemon tick, but it still showed two overlapping dots and each tooltip described only one block's contribution — misleading when, say, an aged-out and a found event cancel in the count but the luck still jumps (window denominator shifts). The marker now collapses all events at the same tick into a single dot. Tooltip behaviour: one event = the familiar single-block readout; multiple events = a "N events landed in the same daemon tick" summary plus a per-event block listing with a green `found` or red `aged out` badge, so the operator can see which blocks combined to produce the visible luck step. Translations cover en + nl + es.

### `[Infra]` Public-IP poll interval dropped from 5 min to 60 s

The daemon polls api.ipify.org to keep its view of the box's public IPv4 in sync; that interval was 5 min, which meant up to 5 min between a router IP rotation and the DDNS updater noticing. Dropped to 60 s so the worst-case detection lag is now ~1 min, the DDNS A record gets refreshed correspondingly fast, and the rejection-rate spike that follows a router IP change (Datum and Braiins connections re-establishing) is shorter. ipify.org has no published rate limit and serves billions of requests/day; 60 calls/hour per box is well within "polite use."

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck step dots now place at the block's actual timestamp, not by scanning for count changes

Two cases were producing wrong or missing dots on the pool-luck right-axis line:

1. When two block events landed within the same daemon tick (e.g. one block found at 09:04:44, another aged out at 09:04:49, both reflected in the 09:05 tick), the count stayed constant even though luck visibly stepped (the window denominator shifted). Both events failed the `c > baseCount` / `c < baseCount` comparison, so neither dot was placed. The line jumped but no marker explained it.
2. When two aged-out events happened hours apart on the same chart, the first block's 'out' algorithm scanned forward up to 15 buckets looking for a count drop and bound itself to the *second* block's actual aged-out timestamp - mislabelling the dot's tooltip with the wrong block.

Replaced the count-delta scan with direct timestamp anchoring: the dot for each event sits at the first tick at-or-after the event time, and the tooltip's `luckBefore → luckAfter` reads off the two flanking ticks. Anchors stay attached to the correct block; cancellation cases now show overlapping dots at the same x with each block's tooltip intact.

### `[UI]` Range-bound values now explain themselves on hover

Several values in the side cards and stat bar update with the chart-range selector at the top of the Status page, but until now there was no way to tell which ones from the labels alone. Affected fields: the Braiins card's `rejection rate` row, the stat bar's `uptime` / `avg braiins` / `avg datum` / `avg ocean` / `avg cost vs hashprice` cards, and the mini `avg overpay (intent / settled)` cards. Tooltips on all of these now explicitly say the value is computed over the selected chart range and updates with the range selector. No visual marker — the discoverable hover pattern already used by every other row stays consistent. Translations cover en + nl + es.

### `[UI]` IP-change marker now uses the styled tooltip and locale-aware date/time (#250 follow-up)

The router-icon marker on the hashrate and price charts used to surface a native browser tooltip via the SVG `<title>` element, with the date rendered through `toLocaleString()` (no locale arg) - so users with non-en preferences saw `6/4/2026, 3:22:17 AM` regardless of their dashboard language. Replaced with the same floating panel that pool-block and difficulty-retarget markers use: sky-300 uppercase header, monospace IP pair separated by the Unicode arrow `→`, and the timestamp formatted through `useFormatters().timestamp()` so it picks up both the display locale and the configured date layout. Hover to preview, click to pin. Translations cover en + nl + es.

### `[UI]` Chart bucket size now scales smoothly with the visible span (no more 30× cliff at 24h)

Scrolling the hashrate chart one wheel tick past 24h used to change the chart's appearance dramatically: the visible span grew ~8% but the bucket size jumped from 60s (raw) to 1800s (30 min) - a **30× step** - which flipped right-axis series like the Braiins rejection rate from per-tick spikes (visible to 10%) to bucket-averaged smooth (<1%) on identical data. Cause: `pickBucketForSpan` was a 4-tier ladder (`≤24h → raw`, `≤30d → 30 min`, `≤365d → 1 h`, `else → 1 d`) with hard boundaries. Replaced with a continuous formula: `bucketMs = ceil(spanMs / 1440)` clamped to the 60s tick interval floor. At 24h that's exactly 60s → raw mode (unchanged); at 30h it's 75s; at 7d it's 7 min (vs the old 30 min, so 1w charts now show 4× more detail); at 30d it lands back on 30 min (matches the old tier); at 365d it's ~6h. Smooth ramp end-to-end - no preset boundary jumps. Daemon-side change in `packages/shared/src/chart-ranges.ts` only, no migration. Existing presets stay at the same effective bucket where they previously sat; everything *between* presets is now a proportional ramp instead of a cliff.

### `[Infra]` Daemon crash safety net + `status.sh` now sees the systemd service (#251)

The daemon had no global `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handler, so a single stray promise rejection anywhere could silently kill the whole process - on a systemd box that just looks like a mysterious restart. It now logs the stack, fires a best-effort Telegram alert ("crashed (...) - systemd will restart it"), and exits cleanly so systemd brings it back, instead of vanishing. Separately, `scripts/status.sh` only ever checked the nohup PID file, so on a systemd box it always reported "not running" no matter how healthy the service was; it now detects the systemd unit first and reports `systemctl is-active` plus recent journal lines, falling back to the PID file only on nohup installs. README C.4/C.5 clarified that the nohup helper scripts don't control a systemd-managed daemon.

### `[Feature]` Track public-IP changes and mark them on the charts (#250)

The daemon now records every time your public IP actually rotates (old → new) as a persisted event, and surfaces it two ways. The Dynamic DNS card gains an **"IP last changed"** line - the real answer to "when did my IP change," distinct from the existing "last successful push" (which only reflects the hourly DDNS keep-alive heartbeat, not a change). And the hashrate and price charts now draw a **router-icon marker** at each IP-change time, with a hover tooltip showing the old → new address. This is aimed at the rejection-rate question: a new public IP briefly breaks the connection between Braiins and your pool, so a rejection spike that lines up with a marker has a likely cause you can now see at a glance.

### `[UI]` Single-character unit symbols (≡, %, ₿) now sit in a fixed-width centered slot so they align across rows

Operator: after the percent-styling change, `0,0107 %` (share log) and `722.513 ≡` (unpaid) right-aligned to the same container edge but the visible glyphs landed at slightly different x-positions because the icon font glyph and the percent character have different intrinsic widths. Now the SatUnit helper wraps single-symbol units in a `w-3 text-center` inline slot so the visible centers align regardless of glyph width. Compound units like `≡/PH/day` skip the fixed slot and render naturally — they're not the alignment-sensitive case.

### `[UI]` Percent symbol now mirrors the sat symbol's muted styling (small space + slate-500)

Operator: the sat symbol on numeric values has a small space before it and renders in muted slate, but the percent symbol on share log / uptime / return-on-spend / rejection rate had no space and rendered in the main text colour. Inconsistent for no good reason. Extended the value-formatter's unit detection to also recognise a trailing `%`, so every percentage-bearing row inherits the same number-then-muted-unit treatment: small left margin between the number and the symbol, symbol in `text-slate-500` at one font size down. Same change reaches the uptime stat card (the `%` now sits below the big number, matching the other stat cards' unit row), the Ocean panel's share log, the Braiins card's rejection rate row, and the new lifetime P&L "return on spend" row in one pass.

### `[UI]` "return on spend" percentage on its own row in the lifetime P&L card (#249)

Build 584 added the percentage in parentheses next to the `= net` value. Operator: that pushes the sat-column right-alignment out of whack - all the figures used to line up at the unit symbol, and the trailing `(−7.1%)` breaks that. Moved the percentage to a dedicated row immediately below `= net`, labeled "return on spend", same green/red sentiment colour as the net line above. Empty sign-column slot keeps the label visually aligned under "net". The four sat rows above (spent / unpaid earnings / collected / net) now align cleanly at the unit symbol again.

### `[Feature]` Net P&L now shows return-on-spend percentage in the Lifetime card (#249)

The Profit & Loss · lifetime card has a new row labelled "return on spend" under the `= net` line: net divided by spent, expressed as a percentage. Reads as "how much have we made (or lost) relative to what we paid for hashrate". At the start of a run, when only spend has happened, the number is close to −100%; as Ocean's unpaid earnings climb and on-chain payouts land, it walks toward 0% (broken even) and then positive (earning more than we paid). Hidden when spent is 0 or net is still computing. Per a user request.

### `[Feature]` Drag to reorder the dashboard cards (#244)

Every block on the Status page (hero, the period selector, the indicators strip, the hashrate and price charts each on their own, the Braiins/Datum/Ocean pipeline, bids, Profit & Loss, and the rest) can now be reordered to taste. Hit **Rearrange** in the top bar, drag any card by its title bar into the order you want - want lifetime P&L up top so you don't have to scroll on your phone? Put it there. The order is saved **per-device** in the browser, so your phone and your desktop keep their own layouts (a small screen and a wide monitor want different arrangements), and **Reset** drops back to the default. While rearranging, an always-visible **Done** (and reset) sits in the on-page hint line so you can finish without reopening the menu - especially handy on mobile. Touch-friendly (press-and-hold to grab) and keyboard-accessible. New blocks added in future releases slot into their default position rather than getting buried at the bottom.

### `[Fix]` Rejection-rate chart line now appears on bucketed presets (1w / 1m / 1y / All) (#243 follow-up)

Operator: line visible on 3h / 6h / 12h / 24h, completely absent on 1w / 1m / 1y / All. Cause: the chart's rate computation used a fixed 5-minute lookback window. Raw-data presets (3h-24h) return 60s-spaced points so the window captures ~5 ticks; bucketed presets return points spaced by the bucket interval (1w → 30 min, 1m → 1 h, 1y/All → 1 d). A 5-min lookback on 24h-spaced points sees only the current point as "earliest in window" → no Δ computable → emit lastKnown which started as NULL and never advanced → invisible line for the whole range. Switched to adjacent non-null point comparison: each point's rate is `Δr / Δp` versus the previous non-null counter point regardless of spacing. The cumulative-counter math is bucket-size-invariant, so this works uniformly across every preset. Carry-forward semantics preserved (Δp = 0 holds last rate); bid-rotation reset preserved (Δp < 0 or Δr < 0 breaks the chain).

### `[Fix]` Scrub orphan May 5-6 share-counter rows left by reverted #90 infrastructure (#243 follow-up)

Operator on the canary box: with the new card and chart code mathematically verified, "All" range was still showing ~0.32% while "6h" showed 0.04% on what looked like the same data. Forensics on a copy of the live state.db found the cause. The exact three columns `primary_bid_shares_{purchased,accepted,rejected}_m` were first added on 2026-05-05 by migration `0059_tick_metrics_acceptance.sql` as part of #90 (bid acceptance ratio capture) and the daemon wrote real values into them for two days. On 2026-05-08 commit `e98ec5b` reverted #90 by deleting the migration file from source — but `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` was never run, so on existing databases the columns and their captured values stayed. Today's #243 work added migration `0106_tick_metrics_braiins_shares.sql` to re-introduce the same three columns. The idempotent migration runner (also added today) caught the `duplicate column name` error, stamped 0106 as applied, and continued. Result on any box that ran the May 5-7 builds: two real-data "islands" (May 5-6 from #90, 2026-06-02 from #243) separated by ~28 days of NULL rows. Naive first-vs-last over the whole range mixes two different bids' cumulative counters — meaningless but not negative. New migration `0107_scrub_orphan_acceptance_data.sql` NULLs the three columns for any row with `tick_at < 2026-05-08 00:00:00 UTC`. No-op for clean installs that never carried #90's data. With the scrub applied to the canary box's data, the All range now computes 0.0393% — identical to the 6h range.

### `[Fix]` Card "rejection rate" computed server-side from raw rows; consistent across all range presets (#243 follow-up)

Operator: 6h range showed 0.04%, All showed 0.17% on the same underlying data. Cause: the card was iterating over `metricsQuery.data?.points`, which is the chart endpoint's range-bucketed data. For ranges that bucket (1w / 1m / 1y / All), the SQL aggregation runs `MAX(primary_bid_shares_purchased_m)` per bucket - end-of-bucket values, with the start-of-bucket value lost. On a first day of tracking that spans midnight UTC, the Jun-2 bucket holds the end-of-day value and the Jun-3 bucket holds the current value; the card's per-bucket walk computes only the delta between them (the most recent partial day) rather than the full range. Raw ranges (3h / 6h / 12h / 24h, bucketMs=0) didn't have this problem and showed the true rate. New daemon method `braiinsRejectionPctSince` queries raw `tick_metrics` rows directly for first/last non-null cumulative values across the range, returns one number. Exposed via `/api/finance/range` -> `braiins_rejection_pct`. Card reads from there; no buckets touched. Returns null on no usable counter samples, no shares cleared, or a single bid rotation making the deltas non-sensical.

### `[Fix]` Rejection-rate chart carries-forward through batch-update gaps; aligns with card weighted average (#243 follow-up)

Operator: chart looked ~0% across a 15-min window but card said 0.05% — wildly mismatched mental models. Cause: Braiins's counters update in BATCHES (sometimes minutes between bumps); most chart windows had `Δpurchased = 0` and the chart code dropped to 0% on those, which dragged the visual eye toward "rate is near zero" while the card correctly weighted by actually-purchased shares. Treating Δp=0 windows as "0% rate" was misleading: those aren't measurements of "0% rate," they're "we had no measurable activity in this window." Switched the chart to carry-forward semantics: each batch-sync window emits a new measurement, intervening windows hold the previous reading. Line becomes a step function. Chart-eye-average of a step function aligns with the card's weighted average over the same range. Bid-rotation crossing (`Δp < 0 OR Δr < 0`) resets the carry chain so the line goes dark across the reset until the new bid produces its first measurement.

### `[Fix]` Rejection-rate aggregation skips negative-Δrejected samples (no more -0.16%) (#243 follow-up)

Operator on "All" range: card showed `rejection rate -0.16%`. Cause: on long chart ranges the `/api/metrics` aggregation runs `MAX()` per bucket (1-day buckets at the All preset) on the cumulative counter columns. When a bid rotation happens mid-bucket the next bucket's `MAX(rejected)` can drop below the previous bucket's `MAX(rejected)` (because the new bid hasn't accumulated as many rejections yet) while `MAX(purchased)` still goes up - so Δpurchased is positive but Δrejected is negative. The existing `Δpurchased ≤ 0` guard didn't catch this case; a few rotation crossings pushed the totals negative on a low-rejection-rate range. Added a `Δrejected < 0` skip in both the Braiins card aggregate and the chart's 5-min window.

### `[Fix]` Braiins card "rejection rate" follows the chart range selector (#243 follow-up)

Card was hard-coded to a 10-min rolling window. Operator: "I would think it has to be the average of the selected period. If I select three hours, then that is a three-hour average." Right — same mental model as the AVG Braiins / AVG Datum / AVG Ocean cards. `metricsQuery.data?.points` is already range-scoped by `chartRange`, so the card now just sums Δrejected and Δpurchased over the whole array. Skips samples whose Δpurchased ≤ 0 (Braiins's batch-update gaps and bid-rotation resets) so they don't pollute the divisor or fold counter resets into the rate.

### `[Fix]` Rejection-rate chart uses 5-min rolling window + correct NULL/0 semantics (#243 follow-up)

Operator on Clarent: chart axis came up but no line, just empty across 20 min of data despite the daemon clearly storing values (debug dump shows `primary_bid_shares_purchased_m = 196,593`). Cause: Braiins's per-bid counters update in BATCHES (sometimes seconds, sometimes minutes between bumps), so the naive per-tick `Δpurchased / Δpurchased * 100` was hitting `Δ = 0` on most ticks and emitting NULL. With 95% of ticks NULL the chart line had nothing to draw. Plus the NULL semantic itself was wrong: within an active tracking period, "counters didn't advance this tick" is **0 rejections / 0 purchased = 0%**, not "unknown." Switched the chart to a 5-min rolling window (each point T sums Δ over `[T-5min, T]` and divides). Δpurchased is now nearly always >0 over that window, line stays continuous. NULL is reserved for "counter samples were missing across the whole window" (pre-#243 rows, or `getBidDetail` failed throughout). 0 means "tracking active, no rejections observable in window" - matches operator's "0 vs NULL" semantic. Bid rotation inside the window still produces NULL on that one sample so the line breaks cleanly across the reset.

### `[Feature]` Braiins share-rejection rate: chart right-axis series + Braiins card row (#243)

User-submitted: surface Braiins' per-bid share-rejection rate so the operator can see at what time something went wrong upstream. Migration 0106 adds three columns to `tick_metrics`: `primary_bid_shares_purchased_m / _accepted_m / _rejected_m`, snapshotted per tick from a new per-tick GET on `/spot/bid/detail/{order_id}` -> `counters_committed` for the primary owned bid. The bids list endpoint doesn't carry counters, so this is one extra HTTP call per tick; graceful degradation on failure (fields stay NULL, the tick itself doesn't abort). Hashrate chart right-axis dropdown gains "rejection rate (Braiins)"; the value is derived client-side as the per-tick delta `Δrejected / Δpurchased × 100` so the displayed rate is instantaneous (not the cumulative-since-bid-creation rate Braiins returns). Bid rotation (new CREATE / EDIT_SPEED) resets counters, so `Δpurchased` goes negative on the rotation tick - those samples render as NULL and the chart line breaks rather than spiking off-screen. Braiins service panel gets a "rejection rate" row showing a 10-min rolling-window aggregate. en / nl / es translations added. Per #243.

### `[Fix]` Migration runner reconciles half-applied schema instead of crash-looping

Origin: 2026-06-02, Clarent crash-looped on `duplicate column name: primary_bid_shares_purchased_m` on every restart after build 571's first attempt deployed. The columns were on `tick_metrics` (added by a transient test against the production DB during deploy) but `_migrations` didn't track migration 0106 - the next daemon run kept trying to ALTER TABLE and bailing. Daemon refused to boot. The runner now catches the specific class of errors that mean "this DDL is already done" (`duplicate column name`, `already exists`) and treats them as success: stamp `_migrations`, log a `reconciled` line, continue. Any error NOT matching that pattern (real syntax errors, missing tables in a referencing migration) still propagates so genuine bugs surface loudly. Same behavior protects against any future user whose DB ends up half-applied for any reason (failed deploy, manual DDL, schema drift from an old debug session). Six new tests in `migrations/index.test.ts` pin the behavior including a "subsequent runs are clean skips" check.

### `[Fix]` Below-floor Telegram alert suppressed when hashrate has recovered at threshold-crossing tick (#242)

Operator caught a self-contradicting Telegram message: `[IMPORTANT] Hashrate below floor` body said "Current: 4.24 PH/s; floor: 1.00 PH/s" - current is above the floor. Cause: `state.below_floor_since` is debounced (stays set for FLOOR_DEBOUNCE_TICKS = 3 above-floor ticks after recovery), so the dip-then-quick-recovery sequence had the timer still armed when the 10-min threshold crossed, isBad was true (debounce-aware), and the body rendered with the now-recovered live hashrate. `runTransition` now takes an optional `suppressFire` flag; `evaluateBelowFloor` sets it when `state.actual_hashrate.total_ph >= floor`. Timer stays armed (next tick re-evaluates: if the dip stuck around past the debounce, no firing - because `below_floor_since` clears and `isBad` flips false; if the dip resumes before the debounce clears, fire happens then with a consistent body). Three regression tests pinned: suppress on recovery, normal happy-path still fires, resumed-dip fires on the later tick.

### `[Release]` v1.11.0

BIP 110 scanner restructure (epoch-based ranges, per-epoch breakdown with expandable rows, lifecycle-aware tooltip), Telegram payout-lifecycle alerts (#226: `payout_initiated` + `payout_confirmed`), chart color picker on Display & Logging (#238, 18 named slots with curated palette + native picker + reset), historical network-difficulty backfill from bitcoind (#230), difficulty-adjustment tooltip enrichment (#229), offline-period reconstruction (#241: gap-backfill synthesises ticks every 5 min plus retarget canonical-time markers across daemon-offline windows, multi-gap detection, pool-luck step-changes through outages). Plus: P&L "collected (on-chain)" now reads lifetime received from `reward_events` instead of current UTXO balance (#240 follow-up), boot-time address-mismatch detection + additive backfill on every restart so users who never changed addresses still pick up TXs missed by prior boots (#240 follow-up), pool-block-credited Telegram credit math uses Ocean's actual delta when computable (#239), right-axis constant-data rendering anchors actual value with rounded ticks below (#236), solo right-axis at All range no longer truncates to 24h (#232). Migrations 0101-0105.

### `[Fix]` Historical payout backfill runs on every boot, not just on address change

Operator point: the boot-time refresh in build 566 only fires on `btc_payout_address` mismatch - that's the operator's own test scenario but not the typical case. Most affected users have a long-standing address and never change it; their reward_events is stale or empty because an earlier boot's backfill missed the payout TX (electrs hiccup, transient error, or a now-fixed code bug like the coinbase-only filter that shipped pre-build-558). On daemon restart those users get no refresh from build 566's logic because the address matches. Build 568 adds an additive boot-time `runHistoricalBackfill` kick in the unchanged-address case too. No DELETE - existing reward_events rows preserved, INSERT...ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING is already idempotent on tx_hash+output_index. Net effect: any TX that wasn't found by a prior boot gets a fresh look every restart. No-op on bitcoind-only setups (historical backfill is electrs-only; returns "electrs not configured" error string, logged not thrown). The existing 45s-after-boot timer in PayoutObserver is left in place as belt-and-braces.

### `[Fix]` Gap-backfill detects HISTORICAL gaps, not just the last-pair delta (#241 ACTUAL root cause)

Operator sent over the Taliesin `state.db`. Ran build 566's `runGapBackfill` directly against it. Output: `gap 3.0 min < 10 min threshold; nothing to do`. The 88h May 29 -> Jun 1 outage gap was sitting right there in `tick_metrics` but the function couldn't see it. Cause: the algorithm computed gap = `lastTick.tick_at - prevTick.tick_at` where lastTick was the most-recent `synthetic = 0` row and prevTick was the most-recent qualifying row before it. When the daemon has been running for hours after coming back online (operator restarted SIX times since the outage), the most-recent pair of ticks is normal 60s polling. The historical 88h gap is mid-table, never compared by the algorithm. Across seven builds (560-566) I shipped fixes to the marker placement, the bucket-AVG smearing, the no-bitcoind fallback, the recompute eligibility gate, the boot-chain catches, the address-change refresh - none of them could ever fix the chart because gap-backfill never ran a successful insertion in the first place. New `findAllGaps` walks all `synthetic = 0` rows in the last 365 days, returns every pair where `tick_at - prev_tick_at > MIN_GAP_MS = 10 min`. Each detected gap gets processed independently via the existing `collectRetargets` + `insertSyntheticGapTicks` path. Verified against the operator's DB: 1505 synthetic rows inserted across two gaps (May 17-19 37.7h, May 29-Jun 1 88.2h), pseudo-retarget at May 29 13:06 UTC (~3h off canonical block 951552 mining time, vs zero markers before), `pool_luck_30d` populated for all 1505 with 22 distinct values spanning [0.72, 1.04]. New regression test `gap-backfill.test.ts > REPRO Taliesin: post-outage ticks exist...` pins the new behavior.

### `[Fix]` Collected (on-chain) reads lifetime received + boot-time address-mismatch refresh (#240 follow-up)

Operator on Taliesin: "After I changed the BTC address it changed to zero after I restarted, but before restart it was still showing the old 5,514,380 from my previous address. And by the way, it shouldn't show zero - I know the new address received a payout. They took it out, but that's not relevant. We only count what they put in." Two related semantic + lifecycle bugs.

(a) **Collected_sat was the current UTXO balance, not lifetime received.** `/api/finance` was reading `payoutObserver.getLastSnapshot().total_unspent_sat`. After a payout into the new address was spent, the UTXOs vanished and the tile read 0 - despite the address having a legitimate payout history. Switched the source to `rewardEventsRepo.sumPaidUpTo(Date.now())` (sum of `reward_events.value_sat` where `reorged = 0`). reward_events is append-only and tracks deposits in; spending an output doesn't remove the row, matching the operator's "we count what they put in" definition.

(b) **No way for the daemon to know reward_events is stale after an address change.** The `onConfigSaved` address-change handler clears reward_events and runs backfill on the save event, but if the operator changed the address on a build where the observer was constructed with a boot-time `cfg` const (pre-build-564's live-cfg fix), the backfill ran against the stale OLD address and reward_events ended up with old-address payouts. On daemon restart cfg loads the NEW address from the DB but reward_events still has OLD-address rows; with (a) above now in effect, that would show the OLD address's lifetime received instead of the NEW one's. Migration 0105 adds `runtime_state.last_backfilled_payout_address`. On boot, the daemon compares `cfg.btc_payout_address` against this column; on mismatch (including first-boot NULL) it clears reward_events, nulls `tick_metrics.paid_total_sat`, resets the observer snapshot, kicks a balance rescan + historical backfill, then stamps the new address as the last-backfilled. The `onConfigSaved` address-change branch was updated symmetrically so the address gets stamped after the save-event backfill too. No-op after the first successful boot if the address hasn't changed.

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck recompute lifts the 30d-eligibility gate for synthetic rows (#241 root cause)

After SIX rounds of "still broken" iterations on Taliesin, I extended the local regression test to model Taliesin's actual shape (fresh install, pool_blocks history only goes back 30 days = `LOOKBACK_FLOOR_DAYS`) and finally reproduced the bug. `runPoolLuckRecompute` gates eligibility on `tick_at >= earliestBlock + 30 * DAY_MS` to protect REAL rows from having their write-time-correct `pool_blocks_*_count` lowered by partial pool_blocks coverage. For Taliesin, `earliestBlock = today - 30d`, so `earliestEligibleTick = today`, so every gap synthetic (tick_at in May 28..Jun 1) was BELOW the threshold and SKIPPED entirely. Synthetic rows stayed with NULL `pool_luck_30d`, the chart aggregator saw nulls in 30-min buckets across the gap, and the mauve line interpolated linearly between the last pre-gap real point and the first post-gap real point — exactly the symptom in every screenshot since build 560. The gate was always correct for protecting real rows, but synthetic rows have nothing to protect (write-time pool_luck is NULL by design). The recompute query now uses `tick_at >= earliestEligibleTick OR synthetic = 1` so synthetics get processed unconditionally; partial-coverage recompute is strictly better than null. The Taliesin-shape repro test (`gap-backfill.test.ts > REPRO Taliesin: ...`) reproduces the failure before the fix (`1266 synthetics inserted, 0 got pool_luck_30d populated`) and passes after.

### `[Fix]` Boot-chain stages get independent catches; P&L collected-on-chain reads live address (#241 + #240)

After three rounds of "still broken" iterations on Taliesin, ran the gap-backfill code locally against realistic data and proved it works end-to-end: 1266 synthetic rows insert, pool_luck_30d populates with distinct varying values, 1w-bucket chart aggregation detects the marker. So the bug is not in the algorithm. Two real fixes in this build: (a) each boot-chain stage (`pool-blocks-backfill`, `gap-backfill`, `pool-luck-recompute`) gets its OWN `.catch` instead of sharing one at the end - previously a single failure in pool-blocks-backfill (e.g., a transient Ocean API hiccup mid-page) silently swallowed the chained `.then()`s, so gap-backfill never ran and the daemon looked identical to one that didn't restart with new code; (b) the payout observer's `getAddress` / `getHistoricalEnabled` closures were reading from the boot-time `cfg` const instead of the live `cfgRefHolder.value`, so a dashboard-edited `btc_payout_address` didn't propagate to the observer's scanner - it kept polling the OLD address and the "collected (on-chain)" P&L tile stuck on the old number even though the Config screen showed the new address. Moved `cfgRefHolder` construction up to BEFORE the observer setup so both getters can close over it. Address-change handler additionally calls `payoutObserver.resetSnapshot()` (new method that drops the in-memory `total_unspent_sat` cache) and `payoutObserver.scanOnce()` (immediate rescan) so the tile renders 'computing' until the new address's first scan lands, instead of "old address's total" -> abrupt jump. Also added: a permanent regression test (`gap-backfill.test.ts`) that seeds tick_metrics + pool_blocks rows matching Taliesin's situation, runs gap-backfill + pool-luck-recompute, and asserts both that synthetic rows are inserted with varying luck values AND that the chart's 1w-aggregation logic detects the retarget marker.

### `[Fix]` Gap-fill survives bucket-AVG smearing and runs without bitcoind (#241 follow-up)

Build 562's per-tick gap-fill landed but the operator's 1w view on Talisman still showed neither the in-gap retarget marker nor a step-changing pool-luck line. Two compounding causes: (a) `/api/metrics?range=1w` AVG-aggregates rows into 30-min buckets, and the 5-min cadence synthetics put 6 pre-retarget ticks into the same 30-min bucket as the canonical retarget tick - bucket AVG smeared to an intermediate value, the chart's sustained-check filter (next bucket must match within 0.5%) rejected the marker, the supposedly-visible retarget remained invisible; (b) Talisman is a test machine without bitcoind RPC configured, so the per-tick path was skipped entirely and the legacy single-marker fallback ran instead - leaving the pool-luck line flat through the whole gap. `gap-backfill.ts` rewritten: cadence synthetics now skip the 30-min bucket containing any retarget canonical so the canonical's AVG = newDiff exactly (sustained-check passes, marker renders on 1w view); and the no-bitcoind path now derives a single pseudo-retarget from the nearest-pool-block estimate of the latest retarget height but routes through the SAME per-tick gap-fill machinery, so Talisman gets the pool-luck reconstruction even without RPC (one marker instead of N is the cost of no canonical retarget metadata; the luck line is whole). 1y / All view (1d bucket) is a documented limitation - a 1d bucket containing the canonical still mixes pre and post within the day. Added a boot-time log line announcing `bitcoindClient=available|null` so operators can confirm which path fired without grepping for downstream evidence.

### `[Fix]` Per-tick gap-fill reconstructs pool-luck and retarget markers across offline windows (#241)

The earlier two #241 fixes in this same build (bitcoind canonical timestamp; `synthetic` column for re-runnability) only addressed the single *latest* retarget marker. Operator screenshot after pulling build 561 to Talisman showed both remaining problems still present: the May 29 retarget marker (block 951,552, inside the gap) was missing because the code only ever targeted `latestRetargetHeight = floor(maxHeight / 2016) * 2016` (which had advanced past 953,568, the *next* retarget that happened live after the daemon came back online); and the pool-luck line ran flat across the gap because `pool_luck_*` lives in `tick_metrics` and there were no rows in the gap to host computed values - despite `pool_blocks_backfill` having correctly populated the pool blocks themselves (the icons render, just the line doesn't react). New service `runGapBackfill` (replaces `runRetargetBackfill`) walks back through every retarget height from chain tip via bitcoind, collects every `(canonical_time, canonical_difficulty)` pair whose mine time falls inside the detected gap, then inserts synthetic ticks every 5 minutes across the gap plus one tick at each retarget canonical time. Each synthetic tick gets the difficulty as-of its time. Boot chain reordered: gap-backfill now runs *before* pool-luck-recompute, so the recompute picks up the new rows and populates `pool_blocks_*_count` and `pool_luck_*` from the pool_blocks ground truth - turning the in-gap luck line into one that step-changes on each in-gap pool block. The retarget-marker detection in the chart now finds the diff jump between consecutive synthetic ticks exactly at the retarget canonical timestamp. Without `bitcoindClient` wired, falls back to the legacy single-marker behavior at the latest retarget's nearest-pool-block estimate (preserves the pre-bitcoind path for installs without RPC configured).

### `[Fix]` Retarget-backfill survives previous wrong-time inserts (#241 follow-up)

The earlier bitcoind-canonical-timestamp fix in this same build (build 560) did not visibly correct Talisman's mispositioned difficulty-adjustment marker on first restart: the daemon's previous boot had already inserted a synthetic tick at the wrong timestamp (legacy nearest-pool-block estimate), and the gap-detection logic looked at that wrong-time synthetic as the "previous tick" before the current outage. Because the synthetic row already carried the post-retarget difficulty, the prev/last diff appeared stable — the backfill short-circuited and never reached the new bitcoind path. Migration 0104 adds a `synthetic` column to `tick_metrics` (default 0). Real polled rows carry `synthetic=0`; backfill-inserted rows carry `synthetic=1`. The gap-detection queries (`lastTick`, `prevTick`, `templateTick`) now filter `synthetic=0` so previous backfill rows can't poison the boundary lookup. On each run, any synthetic row strictly inside the detected gap is deleted before the new canonical-timestamp synthetic is inserted — re-runs replace stale entries instead of leaving them behind. Talisman's wrong-time marker now self-heals on the next daemon restart.

### `[Fix]` Retarget-backfill uses bitcoind's canonical block timestamp (#241 partial)

`runRetargetBackfill` previously estimated the retarget block's timestamp from the *nearest pool block in the `pool_blocks` table* plus the 600s/block average rate. That estimate depends on which pool blocks Ocean had returned to each install at backfill time, which varies between machines — producing inconsistent retarget-marker X positions across daemons looking at the same chain. Empirical case: block 951,552 was mined at `2026-05-29 10:29:46Z`, but Clarent's chart marked the retarget at `2026-05-29 10:59 UTC` (close — within 30 min) while Talisman marked it at `2026-05-30 13:11 UTC` (off by more than a day). The retarget block's actual header timestamp is canonical and the same on every machine; `runRetargetBackfill` now fetches it via bitcoind RPC (`getblockhash` → `getblockheader`, two batched calls) and uses that as the synthetic-tick `tick_at`. Falls back to the legacy nearest-pool-block estimate when bitcoind isn't wired. The broader gap-filling work (per-tick synthetic ticks across the entire offline window so pool-luck and pool-block X positions also reconstruct correctly) stays in #241 for a follow-up.

### `[Feature]` Payout-address change refreshes on-chain payout history (#240)

When the operator changes `btc_payout_address` on Config, the existing `reward_events` rows belong to the old address and the `tick_metrics.paid_total_sat` values were derived from those — they're now stale. The `onConfigSaved` hook detects the change and (a) clears the `reward_events` table, (b) sets `tick_metrics.paid_total_sat = NULL` across history, then (c) immediately kicks `runHistoricalBackfill` against the new address. The backfill's existing `onRewardsChanged` callback re-runs `runPoolLuckRecompute` automatically, so the dashboard's collected-on-chain card reflects the new address within one tick. `historical_payouts_offset_sat` is operator-set and untouched — separate concern.

### `[Fix]` Drop coinbase-only filter in historical payout backfill (#240)

The historical-backfill electrs path silently dropped any non-coinbase transaction at the configured payout address, on the assumption that Ocean's "non-custodial coinbase-direct" payout model meant every payout would be a coinbase. Empirically false: a user-submitted issue (#240, build 556) surfaced an Ocean payout via a 170-output batched sweep from Ocean's pool wallet (P2SH `37dvwZZoT3D7RXpTCpN2yKzMmNs2i2Fd1n`), funded by Ocean coinbase outputs but one hop removed when reaching the operator's address. The `if (!isCoinbase) continue;` gate at `payout-observer.ts:610` rejected it — backfill reported "0 coinbase, 0 new reward_events row(s)" and the dashboard's collected-on-chain card stayed at 0. Removed the filter: any output paying the configured address counts. Edge cases (operator self-send, exchange withdrawal, swap change) get folded into the count and can be subtracted via `historical_payouts_offset_sat`. The `coinbaseSeen` field on `HistoricalBackfillResult` (and the `coinbase_seen` HTTP response field) renamed to `withMatchingOutputs` / `with_matching_outputs` to match the new semantic. Dashboard "Backfill now" toast wording updated; en + nl + es translations updated. The `ocean-pool` skill memory updated with the empirical batched-sweep model.

### `[Fix]` Chart hang / out-of-memory on right-axis range switch (#236 follow-up #2)

When switching the chart range to one whose visible data has multiple distinct values for the active right-axis series but a tiny absolute rawSpan relative to the value's magnitude (real case from the operator's data: `network_difficulty` at 24h with two values 0.15 apart at scale `1.39 × 10¹⁴`), `niceYTicks` could compute a `step` smaller than IEEE 754's mantissa resolution at the data's magnitude. The accumulator loop `for (let v = lo; ...; v += step)` then has `v + step === v` — the loop never progresses, runs forever, and allocates SVG tick labels until Firefox throws `out of memory`. Hardened `niceYTicks` with three guards: rejects NaN / Infinity inputs (returns `[]`), floors `step` at `max(|dataMin|, |dataMax|) × Number.EPSILON × 16` so the accumulator can always increment, and hard-caps the output at 50 ticks plus a secondary `v === prev` no-progress break that bails immediately rather than spinning. Six new unit tests in `chart-axis.test.ts` pin the new behavior; the operator's real-data scenario is one of them.

### `[UI]` Ocean panel row renamed "pool blocks all time" → "pool blocks since start"

Operator note: "all time" reads as if the count covers the lifetime of the pool, but the value is the count Ocean has found since this daemon started tracking — which is what the tooltip already says. Renamed the row label to match the truthful framing. Tooltip wording unchanged. Internal field names (`blocks_all_time`, `pool_luck_all_time`) untouched. en + nl + es translations updated.

### `[Fix]` Chart-color picker: hex input replaces broken Paste button + Copy icon (#238 follow-up #2)

The Paste button shipped in the first follow-up used `navigator.clipboard.readText()`, which is undefined on LAN-HTTP contexts (the operator's `http://clarent:3010`) and gated by an explicit permission grant even in secure contexts — net effect: clicking Paste did nothing. Replaced with a hex text input next to the native color picker; operator pastes (`Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`) or hand-types and a valid `#RRGGBB` (or bare `RRGGBB`) applies immediately. Copy button now carries a Lucide `Copy` SVG icon (inlined per the icons-from-lucide memory) and briefly flashes a check icon on success instead of relying on a text label swap. en + nl + es translations updated.

### `[UI]` Copy / Paste hex in the chart-color picker (#238 follow-up)

Each `ChartColorPicker` popover gains a Copy / Paste row so the operator can mirror a hex from one slot to another without retyping — handy for "use the same color on both charts' right axis" or any cross-series matching. Copy uses the existing `copyToClipboard` helper (which already handles insecure LAN-HTTP contexts via `document.execCommand` fallback). Paste reads from `navigator.clipboard`, accepts `#RRGGBB` or bare `RRGGBB`, and validates against the same hex pattern the picker uses elsewhere; non-hex paste is a silent no-op. Copy button shows a brief "Copied" confirmation for 1.2s on success. en + nl + es translations added.

### `[Fix]` Pool-block-credited alert reports actual Ocean credit, not share-log estimate (#239)

The `pool_block_credited` Telegram body computed credit as `share_log_pct × reward / 100` — an estimate from a single-tick snapshot near block time. With operator hashrate fluctuating inside Ocean's ~80-min TIDES window or with unusually-fee-heavy blocks, that estimate could diverge from Ocean's actual TIDES credit by 3× or more. Operator's screenshot: alert reported credit `~31,044 sat` for block 951997 but the unpaid jumped from 400,045 → 491,682 (an actual credit of 91,637 sat). The unpaid totals are ground truth from Ocean's API; the per-block credit estimate isn't. Now tracking previous unpaid_sat at the moment of the last `pool_block_credited` fire (in-memory). On the next single-block-this-tick alert with a non-negative delta the credit number becomes the actual delta — no `~` prefix. Multi-block ticks, the first alert after restart, and alerts firing right after a payout fall back to the `~estimate` (those edge cases can't reliably back-derive a per-block credit). Body rewording: "Credited to you: 30,477 sat (~0.0098% pool share at the time)" — the percentage now reads as context, not as the math derivation. en + nl + es updated symmetrically.

### `[Feature]` Chart-color picker on Display & Logging (#238 step 3)

Third commit of the chart-color overrides feature; the operator-facing UI lands. New `ChartColorPicker` component renders a swatch button + click-to-open popover (`<details>` element with click-outside dismiss) carrying the 12 curated preset swatches, a native color input for custom picks, and a "Reset to default" link. New `ChartColorsSection` on the Display & Logging tab groups the 18 series by chart (Hashrate / Price / Bid-event markers). Each row: label + picker. Header has a "Reset all to defaults" link that wipes the override JSON back to `'{}'`. Picks update `draft.chart_color_overrides` via the standard onChange so the existing Save button at the top commits to the daemon and the chart re-renders on the next refetch. en + nl + es translations for all 21 new strings. Config search index extended with both per-row labels and intent aliases ("right axis color", "purple", "palette", "theme") so the search box still works as primary navigation.

### `[Infra]` Wire chart color overrides through Hashrate + Price charts (#238 step 2)

`HashrateChart` and `PriceChart` now accept a `chartColorOverrides` prop (the JSON string from `config.chart_color_overrides`). Each component parses it via `parseOverrides`, then resolves all named series colors with `getChartColor` and shadows the module-scope `COLOR_*` defaults so the rest of the component body keeps using the same identifier names — minimal-touch refactor. The 8 right-axis `'#c084fc'` literals on HashrateChart and the 10 on PriceChart now read from `COLOR_RIGHT_AXIS` (per-chart slot). `Status.tsx` passes `chart_color_overrides` from the config response into both charts. With no overrides set every color is unchanged from before; populating the JSON object on the daemon side now repaints the charts. UI for actually editing the overrides ships in step 3.

### `[Infra]` Foundation for user-configurable chart colors (#238 step 1)

First of three commits implementing per-series chart color overrides. Migration 0103 adds `chart_color_overrides TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` to `config`; daemon schema, repo, types, and env-override map all extend through. New dashboard module `lib/chartColors.ts` carries the canonical defaults table (18 series — every left/right-axis line plus the four bid-event marker hues), 12 curated preset swatches, and `parseOverrides` / `getChartColor` / `serializeOverrides` helpers. `parseOverrides` is defensive — malformed JSON, non-object roots, unknown keys, non-string values, and non-`#RRGGBB` hex strings all silently drop so a stray browser write can't break the chart. 11 unit tests cover the parser, getter, and round-trip serialization plus a snapshot guard that every default is a valid hex. No visible UI change yet; wire-through into the chart components and the Settings panel ship in the follow-up commits.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner: separate Pool and Miner columns (#237)

The signaling-block table had a single column conflating two distinct identities: who built the block template (miner) and which pool the block was mined to. For Ocean blocks the operator wants both visible (Ocean as pool, Roughnecks / Peer to Peer Money / etc. as miner). For non-Ocean blocks the pool tag is the only identity (Foundry, AntPool — no separable miner identity). `extractMinerTag` restructured into `extractCoinbaseTags(hex) → {pool, miner}`: Ocean coinbase → pool="Ocean" (normalised), miner=longest non-Ocean run; non-Ocean coinbase → pool=longest run, miner=null. Desktop table adds a Pool column between Height and Miner. Mobile signaling-block cards stack the two badges vertically in the top-right (pool on top, miner below); non-Ocean blocks show only the pool badge. `Bip110SignalingBlock` adds `pool_tag: string | null`; `miner_tag` retains its #234 semantics. en + nl + es translations re-include `pool` (dropped from the catalog after #234, now reintroduced).

### `[Fix]` Right-axis shows scale + actual value on top instead of single label when data is constant (#236 follow-up)

The previous collapse-to-single-label fix was too austere — the operator wants a real scale, just an honest one. When all ticks render identically (constant data within formatter precision), re-pad the axis with a value-relative minimum (5%) and generate niceYTicks below the actual value, then append the actual value as the top tick. Result: e.g. `132.00 T / 134.00 T / 136.00 T / 138.96 T` instead of one centered label or five identical labels. Applied to both HashrateChart and PriceChart.

### `[Fix]` Right-axis collapses to a single label when all ticks render identically (#236)

Charts with constant data over the visible window would render N right-axis tick labels that all show the same string — most visible on the Hashrate chart's `network difficulty` series at 24h, where the entire window sits inside one difficulty epoch (no retarget) and the 2-decimal "X.XX T" formatter rounds every tick to the same value. Post-processed `niceYTicks` output: render each tick value through the formatter, dedupe by string, and collapse to a single midpoint label when only one unique label remains. Y-scale extent stays at the original padded range so the line still draws at the correct vertical position. Applied symmetrically to HashrateChart and PriceChart. Multi-tick rendering for series with genuine variance is unchanged.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 deployment tooltip: lifecycle-aware copy for LOCKED_IN / ACTIVE / past-UASF SIGNALING (#235)

The deployment-status tooltip now reads sensibly across the full BIP 9 lifecycle, not just the current SIGNALING window. **LOCKED_IN** includes the next-boundary block height and an estimated activation date (`floor(tip / 2016) × 2016 + 2016`, formatted as a date via `now + (next - tip) × 600s`). **ACTIVE** distinguishes MASF vs UASF activation using bitcoind's `bip9.since` field (added to `Bip110Deployment` as `since: number | null`): `since < 965_664` → MASF path ("Activated via the 55% miner-activation threshold at block X on DATE"); `since >= 965_664` → UASF path ("Activated at the UASF flag-day block 965,664 on DATE"); falls back to the short text when `since` is missing. **SIGNALING** tense-switches its UASF clause from "begin enforcing" to "began enforcing" defensively if tip ≥ 965,664 — shouldn't naturally happen (Knots would flip to ACTIVE) but the framing is now safe regardless. en + nl + es translations for five new strings.

### `[Fix]` BIP 110 signaling-block column is the miner, not the pool, and skips Ocean wrapper (#234)

Two related fixes to the BIP 110 scanner's signaling-block list. **Renamed `pool` → `miner` everywhere** (column header, response field `pool_tag` → `miner_tag`, dashboard `PoolBadge` → `MinerBadge`, mobile card label) because the pool the operator mines on is always Ocean; the meaningful identity carried in the coinbase is the miner who built the template (Roughnecks, Peer to Peer Money, etc.). **Extraction logic** previously picked the longest printable-ASCII run from the coinbase scriptSig, which produced inconsistent results on Ocean DATUM blocks: the inner-miner tag and the `< OCEAN.XYZ >` pool-wrapper signature sit side-by-side, and whichever is longer wins. Block 951929 (mempool says "Roughnecks", inner tag 10 chars, wrapper 13 chars) was showing `< OCEAN.XYZ >`. New logic filters out the Ocean wrapper (regex on `OCEAN.XYZ`) and picks the longest remaining run, falling back to the unfiltered list only when filtering leaves nothing. Verified against live mempool.space data for blocks 951929 and 951972: both now match mempool's miner labels exactly. en + nl + es translations updated. Internal-only API; no external callers affected.

### `[Fix]` BIP 110 UASF forecast uses 600s target rate, drop em dashes project-wide (#233 follow-up #3)

Two corrections to the BIP 110 tooltip plus a project-wide cleanup. **UASF forecast**: the previous draft used the observed average block time from the in-progress epoch to project the UASF activation date, which read three days later than the standard 600s-per-block calculation that every block-time calculator (and the operator's own hand math at 144 blocks/day) uses. Switched to `now + (target - tip) × 600s` so the displayed estimate matches what the operator can verify independently. **Em dashes**: swept the source tree for em dashes (—) and replaced with ASCII hyphens per the no-em-dashes rule. The three new BIP 110 tooltip strings carried em dashes; 21 more files had them in code comments and JSDoc. 76 occurrences removed across 24 files. Locale .po catalogs re-extracted, three new translations added for NL and ES.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 deployment tooltip explains both activation paths (#233 follow-up #2)

The SIGNALING-state tooltip now names both BIP 110 activation paths and shows the UASF flag-day block (965,664) with a dynamically forecasted date from the average block time observed in the in-progress epoch. The previous one-paragraph "Your Bitcoin node is in the BIP 110 signaling window..." was read as time-related and didn't mention the user-activated path at all. New copy: "Your Bitcoin node supports BIP 110, currently in its activation window. Miner-activated (MASF): 55% threshold in any epoch locks in early. User-activated (UASF): at block 965,664 (estimated {date}), BIP 110-aware nodes — Bitcoin Knots included — enforce the rules regardless." The forecasted UASF date drifts with network conditions (blocks have been coming faster than 600s on average — earlier September-2026 calendar reference was already off). LOCKED_IN and ACTIVE tooltips unchanged. en + nl + es translations updated for six new strings.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner: mobile header layout + drop "Core" terminology (#233 follow-up)

Two refinements after the per-epoch breakdown shipped on mobile. **Header layout**: the `tip | scanned | signaling | deployment` row with vertical `|` dividers wrapped awkwardly at narrow widths; now stacks vertically below `lg:` and only renders the dividers on `lg+`. **Deployment-status tooltip**: rewrote in plain English with per-status guidance ("Your Bitcoin node is in the BIP 110 signaling window..."). Dropped the old "Core's BIP 9 deployment status for BIP 110..." text — the operator runs Bitcoin Knots, and the project convention is to say "your Bitcoin node" generically (Core was the only outlier in user-facing UI). en + nl + es translations updated for the four new status/explanation strings.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner: mobile layout, auto-expand current epoch, per-row MASF bar, forecasted end date (#233)

Four refinements to the BIP 110 scanner card. **Mobile layout**: the per-epoch table swapped to a stacked card layout below the `lg:` breakpoint so the row content stops overflowing the viewport; same data, no horizontal scrolling. **Auto-expand on scan**: after a scan completes, the in-progress epoch row is auto-opened so the signaling blocks are visible without an extra chevron click. **MASF progress bar per row**: the deployment-level progress bar moved out of the card header and into each epoch row, anchored to the absolute 1109-block (`ceil(2016 × 55%)`) threshold; amber below threshold, emerald at or above. The header retains a smaller deployment status badge with a tooltip explaining the BIP 9 chain-level state. **Forecasted end date**: the in-progress epoch's right-side date now shows the linear-extrapolated retarget date (computed from the average block time observed so far in the epoch) instead of the last-scanned block's time. Marked with `(est.)`. Backend extends `Bip110EpochBucket` with `expected_end_time_ms: number | null`; null for completed epochs and for in-progress when fewer than 2 blocks have been scanned (falls back to the target 600s × 2016 from start). en + nl + es translations updated.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner range: two-option toggle (`Current epoch` / `All`) (#231 follow-up #3)

The five-option epoch-count dropdown collapses to a two-option segmented toggle: `Current epoch` (in-progress epoch only) or `All` (every epoch since the first known BIP 110 signaling block, height 938,903 on 2026-03-01). `All` is the explicit "show me the historical view" opt-in — a bounded ~13k-block scan that takes single-digit seconds on a healthy node. Backend takes `?range=current|all`; the old `?epochs=N` / `?blocks=N` params are dropped (no external callers). Dashboard radio buttons reuse the existing TH/PH/EH segmented-toggle styling. Obsolete dropdown labels removed from the i18n catalogs by extract --clean; the two new strings (`All`, `BIP 110 scan range`) translated for NL + ES.

### `[Fix]` Right-axis solo-mining lines truncated to 24h at All chart range (#232)

At the `All` chart range, the right-axis solo-power / solo-hashrate / device-count / max-temp / max-best-difficulty lines silently rendered only the trailing 24h of data — narrower presets worked fine. `Status.tsx`'s `Date.now() - (CHART_RANGE_SPECS[preset].windowMs ?? 24*60*60_000)` fell through to the 24h fallback when `windowMs` is null (the All sentinel), so the solo-series query asked for `since = now - 24h`. Fixed with explicit All handling (`since = 0`) plus a backend tweak to honor `since=0` as "everything" instead of the previous `> 0` guard that quietly degraded it to 24h. Custom panned viewports now also use `vp.since_ms` directly instead of anchoring to "now", so a panned past window returns the correct slice.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner shows date range per epoch (#231 follow-up #2)

The per-epoch breakdown's Block-range column now carries a secondary date-range line ("May 18 – Jun 1, 2026") derived from the first and last scanned block timestamps in each epoch. Locale-aware (UI-language driven month names) and collapses to a single date when both endpoints fall on the same calendar day (in-progress epoch right after a retarget). Backend extends `Bip110EpochBucket` with `start_time_ms` / `end_time_ms` populated from the same block headers we already fetch for signaling detection — no extra RPC.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner consolidates two tables into expandable epoch rows (#231 follow-up)

The per-epoch breakdown and the signaling-blocks list were two separate tables stacked on top of each other. Replaced with a single table where each epoch row is clickable: rows with ≥1 signaling block expand to show those blocks inline (desktop signaling-block table / mobile cards reused as-is). Rows with zero signaling blocks have no chevron and aren't clickable — visually unmuted to mark them as "nothing to see here". Default state is all-collapsed. en + nl + es translations updated for the two new tooltip strings.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 scanner ranges by difficulty epoch, not block count (#231)

The scanner's range dropdown used to offer arbitrary block counts (2016 / 4032 / 8064 / 16128 / 32256) and report a single sliding-window percentage that didn't correspond to anything activation-relevant — BIP 9 / MASF evaluates signaling per difficulty epoch, so a 2016-block window that straddles two epochs produces a number with no meaning for activation. Replaced with epoch-aligned options: `Current epoch`, `Current + last 1`, `Current + last 3`, `Current + last 6`, `Current + last 12`. Backend computes the range as `floor(tip / 2016) * 2016 - N * 2016` through `tip` and returns a new `epochs[]` array with one bucket per epoch (start/end height, scanned, signaling count, signaling pct, in_progress flag). UI renders a per-epoch breakdown table above the existing signaling-blocks list — green percentage when an epoch is at or above the 55% MASF threshold, slate when below; the current (in-progress) epoch is tagged so it's clear the percentage is partial. The legacy `?blocks=N` query param is honored best-effort by rounding up to whole epochs so older callers don't break. en + nl + es translations updated.

### `[Fix]` Boot-time backfill of historical network difficulty from bitcoind (#230)

The chart's network-difficulty line started mid-history because pre-existing tick rows hold `NULL` for `network_difficulty` — that column was added by a later migration than the rows themselves. Network difficulty is fully reconstructible from any Bitcoin block header (every header carries the difficulty target), and bitcoind RPC is already wired for payout observation; new boot-time service walks the NULL range, fetches one block header per epoch boundary via two batched RPC calls, and writes the appropriate epoch's difficulty into every tick whose timestamp falls inside it. Idempotent, bounded (~26 boundary lookups per year of gap), silent skip when bitcoind isn't configured or reachable. Crucially, the SQL UPDATE has an `IS NULL` guard on every write so live observations from the daemon are never overwritten — this is gap-fill only, the per-tick observation remains the canonical source. Existing installs will see the difficulty line extend back through full history on next daemon restart.

### `[Fix]` Test-notification preview honors Display & Logging → Number format (#227 follow-up #2)

The "Send test notification" button on Config → Notifications still produced English-formatted previews (`#948,512`, `1,062,144 sat`, `0.01062144 BTC`) for operators with Display & Logging set to `1.234,56`. Root cause: `notifications-test-event.ts`'s `SAMPLE_BUILDERS` hardcoded those numeric strings as English literals, so the synthetic values never passed through the same `formatInteger`/`formatBtc`/`formatSat` helpers the live alert path uses. The live alerts were already correct — only the test preview was lying. Each builder now takes a `ResolvedDisplayLocale` argument and routes every synthetic number through the format helpers; route handler resolves it from `cfg.display_number_locale`. Added regression test pinning `pool_block_credited`, `payout_initiated`, `payout_confirmed`, `wallet_runway`, `braiins_deposit`, and `solo_share_rejection` previews against both en-US and nl-NL so future builders can't reintroduce literal numbers. Also added `display_number_locale`, `display_date_layout`, `notify_on_payout_initiated`, and `notify_on_payout_confirmed` to `debug-dump.ts`'s `SAFE_CONFIG_FIELDS` whitelist so `/api/debug/dump`'s `app_config` shows their values (previously surfaced as `null`).

### `[Fix]` Pool-blocks-this-epoch hidden when prior epoch isn't fully covered (#229 follow-up)

The "pool blocks this epoch" row would have shown an artificially low count for any adjustment whose prior epoch started before the operator's pool_blocks data did — a fresh install five minutes before a difficulty adjustment would have read "0 blocks this epoch", misleading the operator into thinking Ocean had a horrible run when really we just didn't have the data yet. `countPriorEpochPoolBlocks` now requires at least one observed pool block at-or-before the prior-epoch's start height (proves we were already recording / backfilled to before the epoch began) and returns null otherwise. The tooltip's existing null-hide behaviour drops the row entirely on those events instead of lying with a low count.

### `[UI]` Enriched difficulty adjustment tooltip (#229)

The retarget tooltip on the Hashrate + Price charts now reads as a proper "difficulty adjustment" summary instead of a thin difficulty-only diff. Title renamed from "DIFFICULTY RETARGET" to "DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT" (the common bitcoiner term, per operator preference). New fields below the existing change row: **block height** of the retarget (derived from `pool_blocks` — any Ocean block in the new epoch snaps via `floor(height / 2016) × 2016`); **avg block time** over the prior epoch (computed exactly from the difficulty delta via Bitcoin's own retarget formula `600s × (old / new)`, format `9m 52s`); **network hashrate** at the new difficulty (`difficulty × 2³² / 600`, rendered in EH/s); **pool blocks this epoch** (count of Ocean blocks in the prior epoch's height range — operator-relevant context). All four fields are dashboard-side derivations, no daemon changes. Block height and pool-block count hidden when `pool_blocks` doesn't have a nearby block to anchor against. en + nl + es translations.

### `[Infra]` Renamed legacy `braiins.*` localStorage keys to `hashrate-autopilot.*` (#228)

The project was originally Braiins-only and the dashboard's browser-persistence keys inherited the brand prefix. After the project's market-agnostic repositioning, that prefix became misleading — DevTools and any browser-side tooling surfaced "braiins.*" for things that have nothing to do with the Braiins marketplace (dashboard password, UI language, number format, denomination toggle, chart right-axis selection, alert ack filter, etc.). Renamed all 14 keys to `hashrate-autopilot.*` across 11 source files. New `migrateLegacyStorageKeys()` helper runs once at app bootstrap (called from `main.tsx` before `createRoot().render`); copies any legacy `braiins.*` value into its new key and deletes the old. Existing operators keep every preference automatically — no re-login, no re-pick. Idempotent. Also renamed the root `package.json` `name` from `braiins-hashrate-control` to `hashrate-autopilot` and broadened the description to reflect the marketplace-agnostic positioning. Confirmed via deep audit that all remaining "braiins" references in the codebase (BraiinsClient, BraiinsService, `braiins_*` DB columns, `BHA_BRAIINS_*` env vars, UI strings naming Braiins as the marketplace, etc.) are legitimate references to the Braiins marketplace and stay as-is. Structural items deliberately untouched: repo slug, on-disk directory name, GHCR image path — renaming those would break CI/CD and operator setups.

### `[Fix]` Telegram now reads Display & Logging's number format (not notification_locale) (#227 follow-up)

The first cut threaded `notification_locale` (which is the message *language*) into the formatting helpers, but the operator's actual number-format preference lives in the **Display & Logging tab** under `braiins.numberLocale` localStorage. Those localStorage keys were browser-only and the daemon couldn't see them — so an operator with Display & Logging set to NL (`1.234,56`) still got comma-thousand US numbers in Telegram. Promoted both `numberLocale` and `dateLayout` to daemon-managed config (`display_number_locale`, `display_date_layout`) via migration 0102. The dashboard's `useLocaleState` now fetches daemon config on first mount, adopts a non-`system` value from the daemon, or one-shot-migrates the localStorage value up to the daemon when the daemon is still at default. Every setter PATCHes the daemon config so subsequent changes flow through. The Telegram render path reads `display_number_locale` (not `notification_locale`) via a new `resolveDisplayLocale()` helper that handles `'system'` (→ en-US fallback) and `'no-grouping'` (→ en-US with thousand separators disabled). Existing operators with localStorage already set keep their preference automatically.

### `[Fix]` Telegram messages now use the operator's notification_locale for number formatting (#227)

Every Telegram alert body used to hard-code `toLocaleString('en-US')` and bare `.toFixed(N)`, so a Dutch or Spanish operator running with `notification_locale: 'nl' | 'es'` received numbers with English thousand-and-decimal separators regardless of preference. Centralised the formatting in a new `packages/daemon/src/i18n/format-numbers.ts` module with locale-aware `formatInteger` / `formatBtc` / `formatSat` / `formatSatAmount` / `formatFixed` / `formatPct` helpers backed by `Intl.NumberFormat`, threaded through every alert body (~25 sites across `alert-evaluator.ts` and `braiins-deposit-watcher.ts`). The two duplicate `formatSatAsBtc` helpers (one in each file) collapsed into a single central `formatSatAmount`. EN output unchanged (comma thousands, period decimal); NL and ES now correctly render period thousands and comma decimal. 18-test isolated coverage of the helpers; existing alert-evaluator tests still pass.

### `[UI]` Payout-lifecycle Telegram message wording (#226 follow-up)

Operator review of #226's first cut: the `payout_initiated` body claimed the payout was "now committed to the coinbase of the next block Ocean finds." Empirically operators see payouts confirm in non-Ocean blocks too, so the language overcommits. Reworded to "A payout has been initiated. On-chain confirmation follows; you'll get a second message when the transaction lands." — sticks to what we can actually prove from the data (the balance dropped). The `payout_confirmed` body also dropped its "Coinbase payout of …" prefix in favour of plain "Payout of …" for the same reason, and the truncated tx id was removed entirely for operator privacy (the chart already deep-links each payout to a block explorer; broadcasting tx ids through Telegram chat history is more exposure than the event warrants). en + nl + es bodies updated symmetrically.

### `[Feature]` Telegram alerts for the Ocean payout lifecycle (#226)

Two new opt-in INFO Telegram alert classes, each gated by its own config toggle (Config → Notifications → Ocean events). Both default off, matching the existing `notify_on_pool_block_credit` (#117) and `notify_on_braiins_deposit` (#130) conventions. **`payout_initiated`** fires the tick the daemon observes Ocean debiting your unpaid balance: detected as a sharp one-tick drop in `ocean_unpaid_sat` (>30% of the prior value) with the residual below the 1,048,576-sat payout threshold. At that moment Ocean has committed the payout to the coinbase of the next block it finds; the transaction hasn't confirmed on-chain yet. Body includes pre-drop and residual balances plus the inferred payout amount. **`payout_confirmed`** fires when the on-chain payout scanner observes a coinbase output crediting your payout address — one INFO per new row in the `reward_events` ledger, with block height + payout amount + truncated tx id. Idempotency via an in-memory `lastNotifiedRewardEventId` watermark (silent-baseline on first tick after boot so a fresh-install backfill of historical rows doesn't fire a flood). Migration 0101 adds the two columns. en + nl + es alert copy.

## 2026-05-29

### `[Release]` v1.10.0

Fee protection + configurable EDIT_PRICE deadband + deadband visible in the EDIT_PRICE event tooltip; chart-marker cap now counts visible events (fixes "EDIT_PRICE markers vanish at the 12h/24h view"); pool-block dots on the unpaid line now correctly track distinct Ocean refresh steps; pool-luck tooltip wording correction. New migrations 0099 + 0100.

### `[Fix]` chart_max_markers cap now counts visible events, not the buffered fetch window (#225)

The dashboard pre-fetches 3× the visible range (1× visible + 1× buffer on each side) for pan/zoom snappiness, but the chart-marker cap was counting the full fetched set. On an actively-editing controller (~18 events/hour observed today), a 12h view fetched ~36h ≈ 650 events; the cap at 500 fired and the EDIT_PRICE drop step nuked every yellow marker, even though only ~220 were in the visible 12h. Shrinking to 6h made markers reappear because the fetch dropped to ~325 events. Now the cap counts events filtered to `vp.since_ms..vp.until_ms` (the settled viewport); the global step-down drops still apply to the arrays passed to PriceChart, so the buffered out-of-view events stay loaded for pan/zoom but don't inflate the cap decision. `markersHiddenCount` is also now the count visible would have been hidden, not the count in the buffered superset.

### `[UI]` Show bid_edit_deadband_pct in EDIT_PRICE tooltip (#224)

The EDIT_PRICE event tooltip's MARKET AT THIS TICK section now shows the deadband that was in effect at the moment of the edit, as a percentage and the equivalent sat/PH/day floor (e.g. `20 % (≈ 200 sat/PH/day)`). Captured per-tick into `tick_metrics.bid_edit_deadband_pct` via migration 0100 so historical events render the right value even after the operator changes the knob. The `DEFAULT 20` on the column backfills every existing row to 20 (the legacy hard-coded `overpay / 5` value), so tooltips on pre-#222 events show the historically correct deadband. Also fixes a missed Dutch translation of "Braiins fee above your threshold" from #222.

### `[Feature]` Configurable fee threshold + edit deadband (#222)

Two new operator-configurable knobs on Config → Strategy under a new "Fee protection" section. **Max acceptable fee** (`max_acceptable_fee_pct`, default 0): when any active owned bid carries a `fee_rate_pct` above this percentage, the mutation gate blocks new `CREATE_BID` / `EDIT_PRICE` / `EDIT_SPEED`. `CANCEL_BID` remains allowed so you (or the Datum-down auto-cancel) can still bail out of a fee-bearing bid. Default 0 = halt the moment Braiins exits beta and charges any fee, matching the existing `beta_exit` Telegram alert. The halt clears automatically once every active bid drops back at-or-below the threshold; the threshold itself is the operator's acknowledgement, no clear button. **Edit-price deadband** (`bid_edit_deadband_pct`, default 20): replaces the hard-coded `editDeadband = max(tick_size, overpay / 5)` in `decide.ts` with `max(tick_size, overpay × pct / 100)`. Default 20 preserves the legacy behaviour (1/5 = 20%). Raise to 50 to halve edit frequency and tolerate ~2x more price jitter before re-pricing - useful as a chart-noise reducer today and as per-edit-fee mitigation if Braiins ever introduces an EDIT fee. tick_size remains the hard floor regardless. Migration 0099 adds both columns with their defaults. The Status panel's proposals strip shows "Braiins fee above your threshold" when the gate fires the new reason code `FEE_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED`. Supersedes the cancelled #200 (absolute knob).

### `[Fix]` Pool-luck step tooltip wording (#223)

The pool-luck step tooltip on the Hashrate chart was labelling the luck value as the "numerator" - e.g. "Block aged out of the rolling-24h window - numerator went from 1.14× to 0.91×." The numerator of the luck formula is actually the block count over the rolling window (an integer, N → N±1); the 1.14× / 0.91× values shown are the pool luck multiplier before and after the step. Reworded to "pool luck went from X× to Y×" on both step-up (block landed) and step-down (block aged out) variants. en / nl / es catalogs updated.

### `[Infra]` Reverted: profit per bucket overlay on the Price chart (#220)

The signed-bar profit overlay shipped on 2026-05-27 read as visually busy on the Price chart and didn't communicate net profit clearly when overlaid on top of the existing bid / fillable / hashprice / max-bid lines and the cube / pickaxe / fuel / gem markers above. Cancelled per operator review. The same chart slot is still available for a future profit visualisation; a line series (matching the existing right-axis pattern) is a more promising shape than bars if the idea is revisited.

### `[Fix]` Pool-block dots on the unpaid line now correctly match distinct Ocean refresh steps (#221)

When two pool blocks were found close together (within ~10 minutes), the per-block dot-projection loop on the Price chart's unpaid line restarted its baseline read from `cursor - 1` for every block. Block 2's scan would re-find the same first step block 1 had already claimed - so both dots projected to the same `(cx, cy)` even when the unpaid line had two distinct step-ups (e.g. `970k → 1.00M` for block 1, then `1.00M → 1.04M` for block 2). On the chart this looked like a single dot at the wrong (intermediate) height, and the second block's tooltip was unreachable. Now: the scan tracks a `scanFromIdx` that advances past each block's claimed step, so block N+1's baseline starts from the post-step plateau of block N. Distinct steps each get their own dot at the correct post-step Y. The genuine Ocean-batched case (block N+1's forward scan finds no further step) still inherits block N's anchor, with an 8-pixel horizontal stagger so multiple dots at one step remain individually hoverable.

### `[Release]` v1.9.0

On-chain payout gems, Braiins deposit fuel markers with balance step-up connectors, BIP 110 activation progress bar with MASF/UASF tooltip, Braiins balance right-axis series, pool-probe error exposure, rich BIP 110 scan cards, and chart viewport/axis fixes. New migrations 0095-0098.

### `[UI]` Deposit markers and connectors in purple (#211)

Deposit fuel icons changed from amber to purple to match the Braiins balance line. When the right axis shows Braiins balance, a purple dot appears on the balance line at the step-up caused by each deposit, with a dotted connector line back to the fuel icon. Hovering either the dot or the connector opens the deposit tooltip.

### `[UI]` BIP 110 activation progress bar

The BIP 110 scan card now includes an inline progress bar showing the current signaling ratio against the 95% activation threshold. A tooltip explains the two-phase activation path: the current MASF (miner-activated soft fork) phase where miners signal readiness via version bits, and the UASF (user-activated soft fork) enforcement that activates unconditionally at block height 965,664 (~September 2026).

### `[UI]` Pool luck step-down tooltip shows from/to values

When a pool block ages out of the trailing luck window, the step-down tooltip now shows the previous and new luck values (e.g. "went from 1.42x to 1.18x"), matching the step-up format used when new blocks arrive.

## 2026-05-25

### `[Feature]` Pool-probe error in dashboard tooltip and daemon log (#212)

When the stratum probe fails, the dashboard now shows the actual error (e.g. "timeout after 2500ms", "connect ECONNREFUSED") as a tooltip on the "stratum DOWN" badge. When the probe succeeds, the tooltip shows latency in ms. Probe failures are also logged to the daemon console at warn level for post-mortem analysis.
