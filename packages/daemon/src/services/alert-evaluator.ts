/**
 * Per-tick alert evaluator (#100).
 *
 * Inspects the controller's `State` snapshot on every tick and decides
 * which of the 9 event classes have just transitioned into / out of
 * a bad state. On transitions it calls into AlertManager.recordAlert
 * (or pairs a recovery row); steady-state ticks short-circuit.
 *
 * State-tracking lives in instance fields, hydrated from the alerts
 * table on boot via `hydrate()`. The hydrate query looks up the most
 * recent "open" alert per event class (open = no recovery row pairs
 * back to it) and inherits its id as the active_alert_id. Without
 * this, restarting the daemon while a bad state was still active
 * fired a duplicate Telegram alert - even if the operator had already
 * acknowledged the prior one - because the in-memory map was empty
 * and the next tick saw "transition into bad state" from scratch.
 * This was a real complaint from the operator during #100 testing.
 *
 * Detectors wired end-to-end:
 *   - datum_unreachable     ERROR - the 2026-05-06 motivating incident
 *   - hashrate_below_floor  ERROR
 *   - zero_hashrate         ERROR
 *   - api_unreachable       ERROR - Braiins /v1/* down for N minutes
 *   - unknown_bid           ERROR - bid in account that we didn't create
 *   - sustained_paused      ERROR - primary bid stays Paused across the
 *                                   Paused/Active oscillation hazard
 *   - beta_exit             WARNING - Braiins fee_rate turned non-zero
 *   - wallet_runway         ERROR - balance / 3h-burn drops below threshold
 *   - pool_block_credited   INFO  - operator-celebratory TIDES credit notice
 *
 * One detector remains stubbed pending a data dependency:
 *   - low_acceptance  needs an acceptance-ratio time series; not yet
 *                     captured in tick_metrics. (wallet_runway shipped
 *                     in #116.)
