/**
 * GET /api/finance - top-level money panel for the dashboard.
 *
 * Combines three sources into a single profit/loss view:
 *   - spent      = scope per config.spent_scope: 'account' (default)
 *                  counts the whole account via AccountSpendService,
 *                  'autopilot' restricts to lifetime amount_consumed_sat
 *                  over ledger-owned bids. (There is no dashboard
 *                  manual-bump path - §7.3's override flow was retired
 *                  unbuilt.)
 *   - collected  = lifetime sat received at the configured payout
 *                  address (sum of reward_events.value_sat where
 *                  reorged=0). We count "what they put in," not the
 *                  current balance - so a payout that's been spent
 *                  still counts. Until #240 follow-up (this commit)
 *                  this was `total_unspent_sat` from the observer's
 *                  in-memory UTXO snapshot; operator caught that
 *                  semantic when a new-address payout-then-spend
 *                  cycle made the tile read 0 despite the address
 *                  having received the payout.
 *   - expected   = Ocean's "Unpaid Earnings" - the BTC amount that
 *                  will land at the next payout (when above threshold)
 *                  or has already been earned but is below threshold.
 *
 * net = collected + expected − spent.  Positive = autopilot is in the
 * black, negative = still digging out of the initial deposit.
 *
 * Each source can independently be `null` when its data isn't
 * available yet (Ocean down, electrs/bitcoind unconfigured, fresh
 * install with no bids). The dashboard renders "-" for nulls and
 * skips them in the net calculation (so `net` is null until both
 * collected and expected have at least one observation).
